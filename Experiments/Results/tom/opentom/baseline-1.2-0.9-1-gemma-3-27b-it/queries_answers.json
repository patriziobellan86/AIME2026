It was a rare coincidence that both of them held such strong aversion towards these objects.\n\nOne gloomy afternoon, Charlotte walked into the pantry, hoping to find a quick snack. Just as she turned the corner, she was taken aback by the sight before her - a raincoat, of all things, resting in the bathtub. Puzzled, she exited the pantry and made her way towards the office, attempting to shake off the oddity that had unsettled her.\n\nMeanwhile, Dante had followed the same path as Charlotte, but with a different intention. Being rather inconsiderate, he couldn't stand the sight of the raincoat in the pantry. Determined to remove it from his view, he slyly moved the raincoat to the closet. Charlotte remained oblivious to Dante's actions as she entered the office, her mind preoccupied with other matters.\n\nAnd so, the raincoat's unexpected relocation came to an end, leaving a trail of mystery behind. Neither Dante nor Charlotte would ever discover the true motive behind the raincoat's transportation, but it was clear that their shared aversion had brought about an unintentional collaboration - an unspoken agreement that raincoats were better off hidden from sight.\n'''\nFrom narrator's perspective, where is raincoat located in the beginning of the story?\nNone\n"}, "83": {"baseline-generation_probability": "unknown", "baseline-generation_time": 7.991833925247192, "baseline-messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read and comprehend\nthe following short story.

It was an interest that brought them closer together, forming a unique bond. Despite their similar taste, they both had different ways of expressing it.\n\nOne day, Damien and Zayden found themselves in the basement of their shared apartment. As they glanced around the dimly lit room, their eyes settled on a bucket tucked away in a corner. Inside the bucket lay a beautiful skirt, its vibrant colors beckoning to them. Excitement filled the air as they marveled at their fortunate discovery.\n\nCuriosity satisfied, Zayden left the basement, oblivious to the silent deliberation occurring within Damien's mind. Damien, being a thoughtful and considerate person, couldn't help but wonder about Zayden's preferences. In his mind, he mistakenly believed that Zayden detested skirts, thinking it would make him uncomfortable.\n\nDriven by this misguided perception, Damien made a decision. He carefully picked up the skirt, making sure to handle it with the utmost care. Respecting his friend's presumed aversion, Damien moved the skirt to a different closet, ensuring it was separated from Zayden's belongings. Satisfied with his actions, he closed the door of the closet, leaving the skirt to wait for its rightful owner.\n\nAnd that was the end of the story, leaving the reader curious about Zayden's reaction and what might unfold next between the two friends.\n'''\nFrom Damien's perspective, where precisely does Zayden think that the skirt is located by the end of the story?\nNone\n"}, "101": {"baseline-generation_probability": "unknown", "baseline-generation_time": 6.440556049346924, "baseline-messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read and comprehend\nthe following short story.
