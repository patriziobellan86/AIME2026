Isabella absolutely despised celery, while Gianna couldn't get enough of it. They often joked about their contrasting preferences, but it never caused any real issues between them.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Isabella and Gianna found themselves in Isabella's front yard. As they strolled through the garden, they noticed a bucket filled with fresh, crisp celery stalks. Isabella wrinkled her nose in disgust, while Gianna's eyes lit up with delight. However, before Gianna could even take a stalk, she suddenly remembered something and hurriedly left the front yard.\n\nIsabella, being an inconsiderate person, couldn't stand the thought of others enjoying the celery. With a mischievous grin, she decided to take matters into her own hands. In order to discourage anyone from eating it, she sneakily moved the entire bucket of celery into an unappealing and unappetizing fridge container or bag. She didn't want to witness the confusion on Gianna's face, so she made her move while Gianna was gone, unaware of Isabella's devious act.\n\nAnd with that, the story ends. The fate of the celery now lies in the hands of those who may discover it in the fridge container or bag, completely unaware of Isabella's scheming ways. Only time will tell if her plan will have the desired effect or if the celery will find its way into the hands of someone who truly appreciates its green, crunchy goodness.\n'''\nFrom Isabella's perspective, where is the celery located precisely by the end of the story?\nNone\n"}, "76": {"baseline-generation_probability": "unknown", "baseline-generation_time": 0.8223550319671631, "baseline-messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read and comprehend\nthe following short story.

It was as if their taste buds were revolted by the mere thought of the starchy vegetable. One sunny afternoon, both Ruben and Victor happened to find themselves in Ruben's back yard.\n\nAs they entered the yard, a peculiar sight caught their attention. Resting atop an old wooden table was a bottle, and inside that bottle was a lonely potato. Ruben's eyes narrowed with disgust, and he knew he had to do something about it. Victor, too, shared the same sentiment, but he watched silently as Ruben took action.\n\nWith a resolute determination, Ruben, who was known to be somewhat inconsiderate, swiftly moved towards the potato. His disdain for it was evident in his every movement. Grabbing the bottle, Ruben marched over to the nearby garbage bin, his goal clear - to dispose of the potato and rid the world of its presence once and for all. As Ruben carried out his task, Victor stood silently in the background, quietly observing Ruben's actions.\n\nAnd with that, the tale abruptly ends, leaving us to wonder what Victor's thoughts might be as he witnessed Ruben's act of potato elimination.\n'''\nFrom narrator's perspective, where is potato located in the beginning of the story?\nNone\n"}, "86": {"baseline-generation_probability": "unknown", "baseline-generation_time": 0.6485371589660645, "baseline-messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read and comprehend\nthe following short story.
