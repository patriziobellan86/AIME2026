She considers multiple factors, including environmental influences, emotional regulation, and coping mechanisms, to develop a comprehensive understanding of an individual's mental state.\n\nThe criteria she uses to evaluate the effectiveness of her mental state models include their ability to accurately predict behavior, identify underlying psychological mechanisms, and provide actionable insights for intervention. She continually refines her models through an iterative process of data collection, analysis, and validation, ensuring that her work remains grounded in empirical evidence.\n\nThrough her work, she appears to be striving for a sense of mastery and control, potentially as a counterbalance to unconscious feelings of powerlessness or inadequacy.
