Dr. Holloway\u2019s descriptive methodology relies heavily on a multi-method approach, combining clinical interviews \u2013 which are more conversational explorations than rigid interrogations \u2013 with comprehensive record reviews, behavioral data analysis (where available), and, when ethically permissible and relevant, collateral information from individuals who know the subject well. \\n\\nCentral to her evaluations is a commitment to minimizing bias.
