This difference in preferences had never caused any issues until one fateful day.\n\nAs the two friends entered the playroom, their eyes landed on an apple sitting innocently in a suitcase. A shiny red temptation amidst a sea of toys. Vincent's face lit up with excitement, but before he could make a move, he abruptly exited the room, leaving Erik alone with the apple.\n\nErik, always the pessimistic one, saw an opportunity to rid himself of the apple that reminded him of his friend's fondness for it. With a determined scowl on his face, he carefully picked up the apple and swiftly made his way to the trash can. He didn't want it to go to waste, nor did he want Vincent to enjoy it. Erik's silent act of defiance remained unseen by Vincent, who was blissfully unaware of his friend's covert operation.\n\nAnd just like that, the apple found its new temporary home in the trash can, away from the clutches of Vincent's eager taste buds. With the task accomplished, Erik left the playroom, a small satisfied smirk tugging at the corners of his lips.

Both Hugo and Genesis couldn't hide their distaste as they exchanged glances, silently acknowledging their shared sentiment.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, Hugo had a plan. He was not one to consider the feelings of others, especially when it came to his strong aversion to corn. In a sudden and swift move, he reached for the box, determined to rid the sunroom of the offending vegetable. Without hesitation, Hugo whisked it away, purposefully placing it in the pantry, where it would be out of sight and hopefully discourage its consumption.\n\nBut Genesis was watching, quietly observing Hugo's actions. She didn't say a word, yet her eyes betrayed her curiosity and confusion. What was Hugo's motive? Why go through the trouble of hiding the corn?
