Given Richard's dislike for hats and no indication he would consider a room's fullness in relation to hat presence positively, it's reasonable to infer Andrew might think Richard would view a room with a hat as 'more full' in a negative context or simply not relevant.

A more direct approach considers Andrew's action (moving the hat to his room) and its lack of direct impact on Richard's spaces.
