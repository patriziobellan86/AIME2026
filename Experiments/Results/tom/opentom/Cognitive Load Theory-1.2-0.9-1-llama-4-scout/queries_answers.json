As fate would have it, Maverick, too, found himself drawn to the porch for a moment of respite. And there, sitting innocently in a small box, was the object of their shared disdain - a pumpkin. Olivia felt a surge of anger welling up inside her, and Maverick couldn't help but feel a similar pang of disgust.\n\nWithout exchanging a word, they both acknowledged the presence of the pumpkin.
