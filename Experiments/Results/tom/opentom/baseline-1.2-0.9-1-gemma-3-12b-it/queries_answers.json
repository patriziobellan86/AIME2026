Mackenzie loved pineapple, while Kevin couldn't stand the sight of it. They lived together in a cozy little house, with a sunroom that held a special treasure chest. And one day, both Mackenzie and Kevin found themselves in the sunroom at the same time.\n\nAs they entered the sunroom, their eyes fell upon the treasure chest. And to their surprise, nestled among the other treasures, was a ripe, juicy pineapple. Mackenzie's face lit up with delight, while Kevin's expression turned sour. However, before they could react, Kevin quickly turned and left the sunroom, unable to bear the presence of the fruit he despised.\n\nMackenzie, being a mischievous soul, decided to have a bit of fun. They knew just how much Kevin disliked pineapples, and couldn't resist the opportunity to show off. So, without hesitation, Mackenzie grabbed the pineapple from the treasure chest and moved it to the center of the dining table. It was the perfect spot to make it a centerpiece and draw everyone's attention to it. Unbeknownst to Mackenzie, Kevin had missed this sneaky act, and the pineapple sat proudly on the table, waiting to be discovered. And with that, the story ended, leaving us curious about the outcome of Mackenzie's little prank.\n'''\nFrom Kevin's perspective, where is the pineapple located precisely by the end of the story?\nNone\n"}, "87": {"baseline-generation_probability": "unknown", "baseline-generation_time": 0.982572078704834, "baseline-messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Read and comprehend\nthe following short story.
