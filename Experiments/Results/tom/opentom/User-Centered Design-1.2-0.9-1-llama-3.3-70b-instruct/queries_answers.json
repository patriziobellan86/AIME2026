Carson and Nevaeh cautiously scanned their surroundings, their eyes fixated on a treasure chest tucked away in the corner. In a synchronistic motion, they both stepped closer to the chest, their curiosity piqued.\n\nTo their surprise, instead of gold or jewels, the treasure chest held an assortment of colorful, abandoned socks. Carson's face contorted in disgust, while Nevaeh couldn't help but roll her eyes. It seemed that even in the depths of this forgotten cellar, socks had found a way to vex them.\n\nBut as Carson glanced at Nevaeh, a mischievous grin spread across his face. An idea sparked in his mind. If socks were his bane, surely he could make them equally troublesome for others.
