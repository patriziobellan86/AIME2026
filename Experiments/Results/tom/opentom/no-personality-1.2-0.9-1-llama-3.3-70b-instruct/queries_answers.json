As they explored the space, their eyes fell upon a container holding a perfectly ripe lemon.

It seemed that even in the depths of this forgotten cellar, socks had found a way to vex them.\n\nBut as Carson glanced at Nevaeh, a mischievous grin spread across his face. An idea sparked in his mind. If socks were his bane, surely he could make them equally troublesome for others.
