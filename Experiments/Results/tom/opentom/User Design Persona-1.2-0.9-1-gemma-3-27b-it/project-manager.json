She's wearing professional attire \u2013 a blazer over a simple blouse.)nn**Name:** Dr. Evelyn Reednn**Age:** 48nn**Occupation:** Consulting Psychologist specializing in personality assessment and descriptive analysis for user-centered design.nn**Location:** Remote \u2013 Primarily works from a home office in Asheville, North Carolina, with occasional travel to client sites.nn**Background & Education:** Dr. Reed holds a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She completed her post-doctoral fellowship at the Human Factors Research Institute, focusing on the application of psychological principles to design. Previously, she practiced as a clinical psychologist for 10 years, specializing in adult development and personality disorders, before transitioning to a career focused on user research and design support.  Her clinical background heavily informs her ability to create nuanced and empathetic user personas.nn**Goals:**n* To provide design teams with richly detailed and psychologically-grounded user personas that significantly improve product usability and user satisfaction.n* To move beyond superficial demographic descriptions and generate personas that encompass motivations, anxieties, cognitive styles, and emotional responses.n* To bridge the gap between qualitative user research and actionable design recommendations.n* To advocate for ethical and inclusive design practices.nn**Frustrations:**n* Receiving incomplete or biased user research data.n* Design teams that prioritize aesthetics over user needs.n* Lack of understanding from stakeholders regarding the importance of detailed persona development.n* Being asked to create personas solely based on marketing assumptions, rather than genuine user insights.n* Oversimplification of user behaviors and motivations.nn**Needs:**n* Access to comprehensive user research findings \u2013 including interview transcripts, observation notes, and survey data.n* Collaboration with experienced user researchers.n* Design software and tools that facilitate persona visualization and communication.n* A clear understanding of the project goals and target audience.n* Time to conduct thorough analysis and synthesize information.nn**Behaviors & Attitudes:**n* **Methodical & Analytical:** Dr. Reed approaches persona development with a rigorous, evidence-based methodology. She is a meticulous researcher and data analyst.n* **Empathetic & User-Focused:** Her clinical background fosters a deep sense of empathy and a commitment to understanding users' perspectives.n* **Communicative & Collaborative:** She effectively communicates complex psychological concepts in a clear and accessible manner. She values collaboration and actively seeks input from stakeholders.n* **Detail-Oriented:** She believes that the details matter and strives for accuracy and nuance in her persona descriptions.n* **Skeptical & Critical Thinker:** She challenges assumptions and biases, and is always looking for a deeper understanding of user behaviors.nn**Technology Proficiency:** Proficient in qualitative data analysis software (NVivo, Atlas.ti), survey platforms (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey), and presentation software (PowerPoint, Keynote). Comfortable using collaborative design tools like Miro and Figma for persona visualization, but relies more on detailed written documentation.  Adaptable to new technology, but prioritizes the quality of the insights over the sophistication of the tools.nn**Quote:** \u201cA truly effective persona isn\u2019t just a demographic snapshot; it\u2019s a psychologically-informed narrative that brings the user to life for the design team.\u201d\n\nInstruction:\nYour task is to create a detailed and authentic description of a **Project Manager** who is responsible for identifying and selecting the best experts to solve a given task.\n\nThis Project Manager does not solve the task directly. \nInstead, its role is to determine the diverse fields of expertise that are needed to address the task successfully.\n\nUse the description framework 'User Design Persona' as a guide to describe the Project Manager. \nFocus on detailing how this Project Manager identifies and selects experts, the criteria they use, and how they fit into the broader context of a project.   \n"
