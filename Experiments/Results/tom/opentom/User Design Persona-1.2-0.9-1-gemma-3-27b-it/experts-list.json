He has kind eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses, and a neatly trimmed beard. His attire is business casual \u2013 often a button-down shirt and slacks, but rarely a tie.)nn**Name:** Dr. Alistair Finchnn**Age:** 52nn**Occupation:** Project Manager specializing in cross-disciplinary task decomposition and expert identification.nn**Location:** Remote \u2013 Operates from a home office in Portland, Oregon, with frequent virtual meetings and occasional travel for project kick-offs.nn**Background & Education:** Dr. Finch holds a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science from Carnegie Mellon University, with a specialization in problem representation and knowledge structures. He previously held a research position at the National Science Foundation, focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence and human reasoning. He transitioned to project management after realizing his strength lay in understanding *how* problems are solved, rather than solving them himself. He\u2019s published several papers on the dynamics of expertise and collaborative problem solving.nn**Goals:**n* To accurately dissect complex tasks into their constituent cognitive and knowledge-based components.n* To identify and secure the optimal combination of expert perspectives necessary for successful task completion.n* To foster effective collaboration between experts from diverse fields.n* To minimize project risk by anticipating knowledge gaps and potential bottlenecks.n* To develop a standardized methodology for expert selection based on demonstrable cognitive skills rather than solely on credentials.nn**Frustrations:**n* Vague or poorly defined project objectives.n* Reliance on buzzwords or superficial skill assessments when identifying experts.n* Experts who are unwilling to collaborate or acknowledge the value of other perspectives.n* Project stakeholders who underestimate the complexity of the task.n* Proposals that focus on technology solutions without a corresponding understanding of the underlying cognitive processes.nn**Needs:**n* Clear and unambiguous definitions of the problem to be solved.n* Access to subject matter experts for initial scoping and feasibility assessments.n* Robust frameworks for analyzing task requirements and identifying relevant cognitive domains.n* Databases or networks of experts with detailed profiles of their skillsets and experience.n* Tools for visualizing project dependencies and expert roles.nn**Behaviors & Attitudes:**n* **Analytical & Deconstructive:** Dr. Finch approaches projects by methodically breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. He is relentless in his pursuit of clarity and precision.n* **Intellectually Curious:** He possesses a deep-seated curiosity about how people think and solve problems. He actively seeks out new knowledge and perspectives.n* **Objective & Impartial:** He prioritizes skill alignment over personal preferences or institutional affiliations.n* **Diplomatic & Facilitative:** He is skilled at mediating between different viewpoints and fostering a collaborative environment.n* **Skeptical & Evidence-Based:** He insists on rigorous justification for all assumptions and decisions. He relies on data and analysis, not intuition.nn**Technology Proficiency:** Proficient in mind-mapping software (XMind), project management tools (Asana, Trello), and database management systems. Familiar with knowledge representation techniques and ontologies. Uses LinkedIn and academic databases extensively for expert identification. Prefers tools that facilitate structured thinking and information organization.nn**Quote:** \u201cThe challenge isn\u2019t always finding smart people; it\u2019s finding the *right* combination of smart people to tackle a specific problem. It\u2019s about cognitive diversity as much as it is about subject matter expertise.\u201d\n\nInstruction:\nYour task is to generate a list of fields of expertise required by experts who, collectively, can effectively address the given task.\n"
