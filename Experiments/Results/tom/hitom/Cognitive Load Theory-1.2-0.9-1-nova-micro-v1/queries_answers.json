Ella, who knows the spinach is in the red_drawer after Jackson's and Jack's actions, privately told Jackson the spinach is in the red_crate, which means she believes Jackson still thinks it's in the red_crate. Jack's private conversation with Jacob about the spinach being in the red_drawer suggests Jack's belief is different from the actual location. Since Jacob can only infer based on events he witnessed or private/public interactions, and he only saw the spinach moved to the blue_drawer by Jack, he would think Jack thinks the spinach is in the blue_drawer. However, since we are tracing Ella's thoughts about Jack's thoughts about Jackson's thoughts about Jacob, and none of them saw the spinach move from the blue_drawer to any other location, the most logical assumption is that Ella thinks Jack thinks Jackson thinks Jacob believes the spinach is in the last known location to Jacob, which is the blue_drawer.", "justification": "The task is complex due to multiple layers of inferred beliefs and the agents' tendency to lie.
