Dr. Vance is board-certified in Forensic Psychology by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP). \\n\\nHer approach to profiling isn't rooted in sensationalized media portrayals. Instead, it\u2019s a rigorous, data-driven process. She meticulously analyzes crime scene evidence, victimology, offender communications (if available), and behavioral patterns to develop a comprehensive psychological portrait. This portrait isn't a definitive identification but a probabilistic assessment of potential offender characteristics \u2013 age range, intelligence level, socioeconomic background, possible motivations, and likely behavioral tendencies. She emphasizes that profiles are tools to guide investigations, not to replace traditional detective work. She frequently collaborates with law enforcement agencies, providing expert consultation on active cases and assisting in the development of investigative strategies. \\n\\nBeyond profiling, a significant portion of Dr. Vance\u2019s work involves evaluating the reliability and credibility of witness testimony. She utilizes established psychological principles and forensic techniques to assess factors influencing memory recall, perception, and reporting accuracy. This includes evaluating the potential impact of stress, trauma, leading questions, and suggestive interviewing techniques. She conducts forensic interviews, employing structured protocols designed to minimize bias and maximize the retrieval of accurate information.

She is an exceptional listener, carefully considering all perspectives before forming an opinion. While intellectually rigorous, she demonstrates genuine empathy for victims and their families, recognizing the profound psychological impact of crime.
