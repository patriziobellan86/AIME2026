William didn't see Nathan's action (moving the cherry to the blue_suitcase) because William exited before Nathan.   But, William can infer Nathan's belief based on exit order and actions witnessed.

Ella also knows that Aiden would trust those who exited later. Given Aiden's last action was moving the persimmon to the green_treasure_chest and no further interactions from Aiden, Aiden likely believes it's still there or in a location he doesn't know about. Amelia's actions would influence Ella's belief about Aiden's belief. Ella knows Amelia thinks it's in the red_box (from private conversation) and publicly it's claimed to be in the blue_bottle. Ella has to infer Aiden's belief based on his actions and exit. Since Aiden moved it to the green_treasure_chest and didn't see further actions, Aiden likely believes it's there. Amelia's belief (in the red_box) and public claim (blue_bottle) don't directly affect Aiden's physical action of moving it. For Owen's belief, since he exited early and made no movements, his belief isn't influenced by later actions directly. Ella, knowing Aiden's action and exit order, and that agents lie, has to piece together based on actions and trust.

Sophia, Owen, and Ella did not witness Aiden's or Amelia's movements directly but know the exit order. Ella privately was told by Amelia that the persimmon is in the red_box (27), but publicly claimed it is in the blue_bottle (26). Aiden's last known action was moving the persimmon to the green_treasure_chest before exiting the closet the first time. Ella exited the closet before Aiden's second movement.

Ella publicly claimed the persimmon is in the blue_bottle (step 26), but privately was told by Amelia it's in the red_box (step 27).

Ella knows Aiden exited before she did and didn't see Amelia's later movements. Ella also knows Amelia's public and private claims.
