Nathan moved the melon to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting the hallway, making it the last known location before Isabella and Lily's exit. Isabella and Lily did not move the melon.

Nathan, Isabella, and Evelyn entered the waiting room after the events in the hallway, and Nathan moved the melon again in the cellar. However, we are focusing on the hallway. Based on the last known location, we infer the melon's location through a chain of thoughts involving who moved it last before each agent's exit.nnGiven Nathan moved the melon to the blue_treasure_chest before Isabella and Lily exited, and knowing agents lie about their beliefs, the melon's location is effectively hidden behind layers of deception. Nathan's last move means he likely lied about its location. Isabella and Lily, upon exiting, would have their own false beliefs about the melon's location based on the last known public information, which Nathan manipulated.nnTherefore, to find where Ava thinks Isabella thinks Lily thinks Nathan thinks the melon is, we consider the last public, unmanipulated location before their exits, which is the blue_treasure_chest, and factor in the tendency to lie.
