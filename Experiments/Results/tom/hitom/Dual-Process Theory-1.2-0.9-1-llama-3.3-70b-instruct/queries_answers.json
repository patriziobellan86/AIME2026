Isla privately told Alexander the lettuce is in the red_pantry, but this information is not directly available to Benjamin or Sophia. 11. Given that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later, and considering the private conversations, Sophia would infer Benjamin's belief based on his statement to her. 12.

Therefore, Sophia would think Benjamin thinks Isla thinks the lettuce is in the red_box, because that is where it was when Benjamin last saw it, but since Benjamin told Sophia it is in the red_bucket, and there is no information that Benjamin knows Isla's actual belief, the correct answer should reflect the lack of direct information exchange between Benjamin and Isla.", "justification": "The grade is high because the reasoning steps carefully consider the sequence of events, the private conversations, and the lack of direct information exchange between certain agents.
