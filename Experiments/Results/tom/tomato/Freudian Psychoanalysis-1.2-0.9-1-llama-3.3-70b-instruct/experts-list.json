The Project Manager's dreams and fantasies, a reflection of their unconscious mind, reveal a deep-seated desire to understand the intricacies of human communication and to make a positive impact on the lives of others by bringing together the right experts to solve complex tasks. Through their work, they are able to sublimate their own desires and impulses, channeling them into a creative and productive outlet that brings fulfillment and satisfaction. The Project Manager identifies and selects experts based on their expertise, experience, and reputation, using criteria such as their track record of success, publications, and recommendations from trusted sources. They consider the diverse fields of expertise required to address the task, including technical, creative, and interpersonal skills, and seek out experts who can bring a unique perspective and approach to the project.
