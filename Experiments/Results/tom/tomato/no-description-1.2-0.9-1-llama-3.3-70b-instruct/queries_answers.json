Why, have you had any reports of anything unusual going on?\"\nSasha Ramirez: \"No, no reports, just my usual paranoia kicking in, I guess.

The pond is just a short walk from here, and I can show you the exact spot where I heard the calls. Plus, it's a beautiful spot, you can't miss it. Shall we take a stroll?\"\nSasha Ramirez: \"Sounds like a plan, I'd love to take a walk and learn more about the local wildlife. And yeah, it's always nice to get some fresh air and exercise. Lead the way, I'm curious to see this spot and hear more about those bird calls.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"Awesome! Let's take our time and enjoy the scenery. I'll point out some of the plants and animals we see along the way, and we can chat about everything from birds to our favorite hobbies. I've got a feeling it's going to be a lovely afternoon.\"\nSasha Ramirez: \"Sounds perfect to me! I love learning about the local flora and fauna, and it's always great to connect with someone over shared interests. So, what do you like to do in your free time, aside from wildlife biology and exploring nature?\"\nAmara Hartley: \"You know, I'm a bit of a bookworm, so I love to read about history, especially natural history.

Let's just take a deep breath, and think this through together, okay?\"\nMia Davis: \"Okay, okay... I'm sorry too. I just feel like I've tried everything and nothing's working. But... I guess you're right. It won't hurt to try. But if this ritual doesn't work, I'm getting rid of that thing, no matter what. And I don't want to hear about sentimental value or any of that nonsense. Deal?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Deal! I'm with you, Mia. We'll do this ritual, and if it doesn't work, we'll figure out what to do with the object together. I promise.
