The curiosity is about the possibility of a shared acquaintance, not directly about Lily's passion for work or her as a person.

It's really comfortable, my wife and I have loved having it in our living room.\"\nWilliam Brown: \"Yeah, I've been looking for a comfortable couch set for my place, and yours sounds great! What makes you want to upgrade to a stiffer one, if I may ask?\"\nAva Martinez: \"Ah, yeah, my wife just wants a change of pace, you know? But honestly, this set is amazing, it's been the centerpiece of our living room for years, and we've had so many great memories on it. The comfort is just unbeatable!\"\nWilliam Brown: \"I totally get it, sometimes a change of pace is needed. I can imagine it's hard to let go of such a great set, especially with all the memories attached to it. So, you're looking to sell it for $550, right? Is there any room for negotiation on the price?\"\nAva Martinez: \"Yeah, that's the price we're thinking, but I'm open to reasonable offers. I mean, like I said, it's a great set, and we're not looking to give it away, but we're also motivated to sell. What did you have in mind?\"\nWilliam Brown: \"I totally understand, and I appreciate your honesty. To be frank, I was thinking more along the lines of $450, considering the light staining and all. But I have to say, you've really sold me on the comfort aspect, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to $475?\"\nAva Martinez: \"I appreciate your honesty too, and I understand where you're coming from. However, I've got to say, $475 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I mean, the staining is really just a minor thing, and like I said, the comfort is just unbeatable. I could maybe do $500, but that's as low as I can go.\"\nWilliam Brown: \"I understand your point about the staining, and I agree the comfort is a major selling point. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we split the difference between $475 and $500, and do $487.50? That way, we both get a good deal.\"\nAva Martinez: \"You know, I appreciate your creative math skills! But, I've got to say, I was thinking more along the lines of $510, considering the value this set will bring to your living room. It's really a steal at that price, if I do say so myself.\"\nWilliam Brown: \"Ha! I like your style, and I appreciate your confidence in the set's value. However, I've got to be honest with you, $510 is still a bit above my budget. But I really do love the set, and I can see myself making many memories on it. Tell you what, I'll meet you at $505, and that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to shake on that?\"\nAva Martinez: \"You know, I've got to say, I'm really impressed with your negotiation skills! And I can tell you're a man who values comfort and making memories. You know what, I think we can make a deal at $505. I'll even throw in some free cleaning products to help you keep the set looking its best. What do you say, do we have a deal?\"\nWilliam Brown: \"Wow, I'm impressed too! I think we've had a great conversation, and I appreciate your willingness to listen to my offers. And the free cleaning products are a nice touch! You know what, I think we do have a deal at $505. I'm happy to take the set off your hands and make some new memories with it. Let's shake on it and finalize the details!\"\nAva Martinez: \"Ah, I'm so glad we could come to an agreement! I think you're going to love this set, and I'm happy to see it go to a good home. Let's shake on it and finalize the details! I'll even help you load it up and get it to your place.
