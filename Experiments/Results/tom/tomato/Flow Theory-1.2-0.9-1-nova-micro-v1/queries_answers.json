I'm not just selling you a script, I'm selling you a potential blockbuster. And for that, I think $250,000 is a steal.

I can see why you think $375,000 is a fair compromise, but for me, it's still a stretch. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $300,000, and that's as high as I can go.

I heard you've been working on a play about your parents' life, how's that going?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Yeah, it's been a labor of love, but I've finally finished it! I think it's a really powerful story that needs to be told, and I'd love to discuss the possibility of your production company bringing it to life.\"\nEthan Smith: \"That's great to hear, I'd love to take a look at the script. What kind of production scale were you thinking of, a small intimate setting or a bigger, more elaborate show?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I was thinking of something in between, a medium-sized production that can still convey the emotional intimacy of the story, but also has the potential to reach a broader audience and spark some important conversations about social justice and environmental activism, which are central themes in the play.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I completely agree, those are really important themes that need to be shared with a wider audience. From a production standpoint, a medium-sized production would likely require a budget in the range of $50,000 to $100,000. Would you be open to negotiating the rights to the play within that range?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I appreciate your honesty about the budget, Ethan, but to be frank, I was thinking more in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 for the rights to the play. I believe the story has the potential to resonate with a huge audience and bring in significant revenue, and I want to make sure I'm fairly compensated for my work.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I understand where you're coming from, Benjamin, and I agree that the play has huge potential. However, I have to be realistic about my production company's budget for this season. Would you be willing to consider a profit-sharing model, where we could offer you a percentage of the profits instead of a flat fee, and potentially revisit the rights fee in the future if the play is a huge success?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I'm definitely open to considering a profit-sharing model, Ethan. However, I'd want to make sure the percentage of profits is substantial enough to reflect the value I believe the play brings to the production. Maybe we could discuss a 20-30% profit share, and also include a clause that revisits the rights fee if the play reaches certain box office milestones or wins any major awards?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want a significant percentage of profits, Benjamin. I could potentially do 20% profit share, but I'd need to cap the rights fee at $150,000. And I like the idea of revisiting the rights fee if the play reaches certain milestones or wins awards. Let me think for a moment... How about this: if the play wins a major award or reaches $1 million in box office sales, we revisit the rights fee and consider increasing it to $250,000?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"That's a interesting proposal, Ethan. I like the idea of a performance-based increase in the rights fee, but I'm not sure if $250,000 is enough considering the potential of the play. How about we meet in the middle at $300,000 if the play reaches those milestones? And what kind of major award are we talking about? A Tony, a Pulitzer, or something else?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want to aim high, Benjamin. Meeting in the middle at $300,000 is doable, but I need to make sure it's tied to a very specific achievement. How about this: if the play wins a Tony Award for Best Play or Best Director, or the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, we revisit the rights fee and increase it to $300,000. That way, we're both incentivized to make the play a huge success, and you'll be rewarded for your hard work if it reaches the highest levels of recognition.\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ethan, I think we've got a deal!
