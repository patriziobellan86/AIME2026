I've heard great things about your play, but I have to be honest with you, our budget is a bit tight this season.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I completely understand, Mia, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I truly believe that this play has the potential to resonate with audiences and bring in a strong return on investment - it's a powerful story based on my parents' lives, and I think it could really connect with people.\"\nMia Davis: \"I agree, the story does sound compelling, Amara.

I'm open to discussing creative ways to bring the costs down, but I do believe that the script and the story are worth a significant investment. Perhaps we could talk about a profit-sharing model or a percentage of the box office revenue to ensure that both parties benefit from the production's success?\"\nMia Davis: \"A profit-sharing model is an interesting idea, Amara.

Let's shake on it and make it happen. I'll even throw in some extra marketing muscle to get the word out. We can make this play a hit, and I think it's time to take the leap.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I love your enthusiasm, Mia! I'm thrilled that we're close to a deal. Before we shake on it, can we just clarify the details of the profit-sharing percentage and the marketing support you're offering? I want to make sure we're both on the same page and that we're setting ourselves up for success.\"\nMia Davis: \"Absolutely, Amara! I'm a woman of my word. Let's say 20% of the net profits go to you, and we'll commit to a social media campaign, email marketing, and a targeted ad spend of $10,000. We'll work together to create a buzz around this play and make it a hit. Trust me, I've got your back on this one.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I appreciate your transparency, Mia. 20% of the net profits sounds like a fair deal, and I'm excited about the marketing campaign you're proposing. Just to clarify, would the $10,000 ad spend be in addition to the $35,000 upfront, or would it be deducted from the overall budget? I want to make sure we're clear on the financials before we finalize the deal.\"\nMia Davis: \"Good question, Amara!

There's no clear evidence that Micah is trying to psyche Naomi out, express disappointment, or indicate a desire for the orange at this point. n3. **Considering the Point System**: The conversation later reveals a negotiation over fruit that seems to have point values, but at the time of Micah's statement, there's no explicit mention of points. n4. **Inferring Micah's Thoughts**: The experts infer that Micah thinks Naomi knows he loves bananas. Given the context of trading, it's reasonable to assume he's expressing his interest in bananas directly, which could imply he wants to get as many as he can if they have point value. n5. **Conclusion**: The most logical interpretation is that Micah thinks Naomi knows he loves bananas, and since they're worth 2 points each (as later implied), he should try to get as many as he can.", "final-decision-maker-conclusion": "Based on the analysis of the experts' responses, Micah's statement 'Oh, definitely bananas!

How's the coding world treating you?\"\nEthan Smith: \"It's been good, just busy as usual. I heard you've been working on a play about your parents' life, how's that going?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Yeah, it's been a labor of love, but I've finally finished it! I think it's a really powerful story that needs to be told, and I'd love to discuss the possibility of your production company bringing it to life.\"\nEthan Smith: \"That's great to hear, I'd love to take a look at the script. What kind of production scale were you thinking of, a small intimate setting or a bigger, more elaborate show?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I was thinking of something in between, a medium-sized production that can still convey the emotional intimacy of the story, but also has the potential to reach a broader audience and spark some important conversations about social justice and environmental activism, which are central themes in the play.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I completely agree, those are really important themes that need to be shared with a wider audience. From a production standpoint, a medium-sized production would likely require a budget in the range of $50,000 to $100,000. Would you be open to negotiating the rights to the play within that range?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I appreciate your honesty about the budget, Ethan, but to be frank, I was thinking more in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 for the rights to the play. I believe the story has the potential to resonate with a huge audience and bring in significant revenue, and I want to make sure I'm fairly compensated for my work.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I understand where you're coming from, Benjamin, and I agree that the play has huge potential. However, I have to be realistic about my production company's budget for this season. Would you be willing to consider a profit-sharing model, where we could offer you a percentage of the profits instead of a flat fee, and potentially revisit the rights fee in the future if the play is a huge success?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I'm definitely open to considering a profit-sharing model, Ethan. However, I'd want to make sure the percentage of profits is substantial enough to reflect the value I believe the play brings to the production. Maybe we could discuss a 20-30% profit share, and also include a clause that revisits the rights fee if the play reaches certain box office milestones or wins any major awards?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want a significant percentage of profits, Benjamin. I could potentially do 20% profit share, but I'd need to cap the rights fee at $150,000. And I like the idea of revisiting the rights fee if the play reaches certain milestones or wins awards. Let me think for a moment... How about this: if the play wins a major award or reaches $1 million in box office sales, we revisit the rights fee and consider increasing it to $250,000?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"That's a interesting proposal, Ethan. I like the idea of a performance-based increase in the rights fee, but I'm not sure if $250,000 is enough considering the potential of the play. How about we meet in the middle at $300,000 if the play reaches those milestones? And what kind of major award are we talking about? A Tony, a Pulitzer, or something else?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want to aim high, Benjamin. Meeting in the middle at $300,000 is doable, but I need to make sure it's tied to a very specific achievement. How about this: if the play wins a Tony Award for Best Play or Best Director, or the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, we revisit the rights fee and increase it to $300,000. That way, we're both incentivized to make the play a huge success, and you'll be rewarded for your hard work if it reaches the highest levels of recognition.\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ethan, I think we've got a deal! I'm really happy with the terms, and I think this is a win-win for both of us. The Tony or Pulitzer trigger for the increased rights fee is perfect, and I'm confident that with your production company behind it, we can make this play a huge success.

What's been going on, maybe we can figure out what's behind this streak of bad luck?\"\nMia Davis: \"Well, it's just a series of weird coincidences, but I did recently acquire this... antique item, and ever since then, things have been going downhill. Do you believe in, you know, 'bad juju' or anything like that?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ha, well, I don't believe in bad juju, but I do believe in the power of our minds.
