Do you think that's possible?\"\nOliver Thompson: \"Well, I'm not sure about the curse part, but it's possible that the box is just a tangible representation of your anxiety or stress, and getting rid of it might help you feel better. What kind of ritual were you thinking of doing to break the curse?\"\nAmara Hartley: \"That's a good point, Oliver. I wasn't thinking of anything specific, but maybe I could do something symbolic like releasing the box into a body of water or burying it in a special place. Do you think that could help me psychologically, even if it's not actually 'breaking a curse'?\"\nOliver Thompson: \"Exactly! I think that's a great idea. The symbolism of letting go of the box could be really powerful for you. And, you know, even if it's just a psychological trick, it could still have a real impact on your mood and outlook. Why don't we brainstorm some ideas for where you could release the box?\"\nAmara Hartley: \"That's a great idea, Oliver! I was thinking maybe a place that holds some personal significance for me, like the nature reserve where I did my graduate research. It's a special spot that always makes me feel grounded and connected to nature. Would you be up for a hike and a little ritual with me this weekend?\"\nOliver Thompson: \"I'd love to join you on the hike and be a part of your ritual. It'll be a great way for us to catch up and spend some time together, and who knows, maybe the fresh air and exercise will do us both some good. Plus, I'm curious to see how this ritual goes down!\"\nAmara Hartley: \"Aw, thanks Oliver, that means a lot to me. I'm really glad you can come. I was thinking we could do a simple ceremony, like writing down things I want to release or let go of on a piece of paper, and then burn it or bury it with the box. And then maybe we can take a moment to reflect and set some intentions for the future. What do you think?\"\nOliver Thompson: \"I think that sounds like a great plan, Amara. And I was thinking, why don't we take it a step further and make it a bit more symbolic? We could write down things you want to release on the paper, and then tie the paper to the box before we release it into the water or bury it. That way, it's like you're physically letting go of those things too.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I love that idea, Oliver! Tying the paper to the box will make it feel more tangible, like I'm really releasing those things from my life. And the act of watching it float away or being buried will be a powerful reminder that I'm moving forward. You're really good at this, you should be a ritual designer or something!\"\nOliver Thompson: \"Ha! I think I'll stick to designing buildings, but I'm happy to be your ritual consultant for the day. And I have to say, I'm getting a little excited about this whole thing. It's been a while since I've done something this... unconventional.

However, I have to be realistic about our company's financial situation. While I'm open to discussing creative arrangements, I'm not willing to go above $20,000 for the acquisition. Perhaps we could discuss a profit-sharing model that would give you a percentage of the profits, but I need to ensure that our company's risks are mitigated.\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I understand your concerns, Ethan, and I appreciate your willingness to discuss alternative arrangements. However, I have to say that $20,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a profit-sharing model, but I need to ensure that my share of the profits reflects the play's potential value. How about we meet in the middle at $30,000, and we discuss a profit-sharing model that would give me 20% of the net profits? That way, we both share the risk and the reward.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I understand your point, Benjamin, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I need to be honest with you - $30,000 is still a stretch for us. I can do $25,000, and I'm willing to offer a 15% profit-sharing deal. That way, we both get a fair share of the profits, and we can work together to make this play a success.\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ethan, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to meet me halfway. I think we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us. However, I need to think about it for a moment. Can I take a day to consider your offer and discuss it with some advisors? I want to make sure I'm making the right decision for the play and for myself.\"\nEthan Smith: \"Absolutely, Benjamin, take all the time you need. I understand the importance of making the right decision for your play. Just keep in mind that our production schedule is moving forward, and I need to finalize our lineup soon.

I think it's a game-changer, and I've already had interest from a few producers, but I think your company would be the perfect fit.\"\nMiles Hawkins: \"That does sound incredible, Sophia.

I'm not just selling you a script, I'm selling you a potential blockbuster. And for that, I think $250,000 is a steal.

I'm okay with you keeping the ball, but... would you be willing to make a trade?

How about this: I'll keep the ball and two books, and you can have one of the hats and the remaining book? That way, we both get what's important to us.\"\nAva Thompson: \"Hmm, that's a fair offer, Hendrick. I think I can live with that. Yeah, let's do it. You can keep the ball and two books, and I'll take the remaining book and one of the hats. I think we've reached a good compromise.\"\nHendrick Heinz: \"Excellent, Ava!
