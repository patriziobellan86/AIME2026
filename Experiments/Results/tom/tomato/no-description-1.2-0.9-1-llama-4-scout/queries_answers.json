I've been doing a lot of pieces featuring mountains, rivers, and forests, and I've been experimenting with different techniques to convey the sense of movement and energy in these scenes. I've also been drawn to the idea of capturing the intersection of nature and human experience, so I've been incorporating elements of architecture and urbanization into my work as well.\"\nZane Bennett: \"I'm absolutely fascinated by your approach! I love how you're exploring the intersection of nature and human experience - that's so thought-provoking. I can totally see how graphic design elements could enhance that theme.
