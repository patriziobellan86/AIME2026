And then maybe we can take a moment to reflect and set some intentions for the future. What do you think?\"\nOliver Thompson: \"I think that sounds like a great plan, Amara. And I was thinking, why don't we take it a step further and make it a bit more symbolic? We could write down things you want to release on the paper, and then tie the paper to the box before we release it into the water or bury it. That way, it's like you're physically letting go of those things too.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I love that idea, Oliver!

Are you a supporter of the organization?\"\nSasha Ramirez: \"Yes, I'm a big supporter of the organization. As a police officer, I've seen firsthand the impact that their programs have on our community, especially when it comes to supporting victims of crime.\"\nEli Dawson: \"That's wonderful to hear, Officer. I'm particularly interested in organizations that support queer individuals, who often face additional barriers when seeking help. Do you know if this organization has any specific initiatives in place to support the LGBTQ+ community?\"\nSasha Ramirez: \"Actually, Dr. Dawson, our organization has a dedicated program for LGBTQ+ victims of crime, providing them with specialized services and support.

We envision a future where our services are no longer needed because the community has equal access to resources and opportunities. This program is a critical step towards achieving that vision, as it not only provides direct support but also helps us advocate for policy changes and social reform. A donation would be a significant investment in creating a lasting, systemic impact.\"\nEli Dawson: \"I must say, Officer, I'm deeply moved by your organization's vision and the critical work you're doing.

However, I'd want to make sure the percentage of profits is substantial enough to reflect the value I believe the play brings to the production.

I could potentially do 20% profit share, but I'd need to cap the rights fee at $150,000. And I like the idea of revisiting the rights fee if the play reaches certain milestones or wins awards.

I like the idea of a performance-based increase in the rights fee, but I'm not sure if $250,000 is enough considering the potential of the play. How about we meet in the middle at $300,000 if the play reaches those milestones? And what kind of major award are we talking about? A Tony, a Pulitzer, or something else?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want to aim high, Benjamin.
