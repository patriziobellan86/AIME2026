Hendrick has been planning a special evening, has a recipe in mind, and a bottle of wine saved for a special occasion. He emphasizes not wanting Ethan to worry about anything and hints at wanting the evening to potentially be the start of something special. When Ethan offers to help, Hendrick declines, insisting he has everything under control. This indicates Hendrick wants to showcase his effort and care without Ethan's involvement. Given Hendrick's expressed nervousness, excitement, and later admission of feeling more than friendship for Ethan, it's clear he's invested in making this evening special and meaningful. He wants to demonstrate his capabilities and thoughtfulness, possibly to express his deeper feelings indirectly through actions rather than direct communication at this point.", "justification": "The conclusion is based on a thorough analysis of Hendrick's actions, words, and the context provided.
