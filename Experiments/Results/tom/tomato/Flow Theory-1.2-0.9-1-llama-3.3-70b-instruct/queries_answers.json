I've heard great things about your play, but I have to be honest with you, our budget is a bit tight this season.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I completely understand, Mia, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I truly believe that this play has the potential to resonate with audiences and bring in a strong return on investment - it's a powerful story based on my parents' lives, and I think it could really connect with people.\"\nMia Davis: \"I agree, the story does sound compelling, Amara. But, as a businesswoman, I have to think about the bottom line. What kind of compromises are you willing to make to make this production a reality?\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I understand where you're coming from, Mia. I'm open to discussing creative ways to bring the costs down, but I do believe that the script and the story are worth a significant investment. Perhaps we could talk about a profit-sharing model or a percentage of the box office revenue to ensure that both parties benefit from the production's success?\"\nMia Davis: \"A profit-sharing model is an interesting idea, Amara. But, let's be realistic, we can't put all our eggs in one basket. I'd be willing to consider a smaller upfront investment in exchange for a larger percentage of the profits. What's the lowest number you'd be comfortable with?\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I understand your perspective, Mia. However, I've put my heart and soul into this play, and I think it's worth more than just a small upfront investment.

Let's shake on it and make it happen. I'll even throw in some extra marketing muscle to get the word out. We can make this play a hit, and I think it's time to take the leap.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I love your enthusiasm, Mia! I'm thrilled that we're close to a deal. Before we shake on it, can we just clarify the details of the profit-sharing percentage and the marketing support you're offering? I want to make sure we're both on the same page and that we're setting ourselves up for success.\"\nMia Davis: \"Absolutely, Amara! I'm a woman of my word. Let's say 20% of the net profits go to you, and we'll commit to a social media campaign, email marketing, and a targeted ad spend of $10,000. We'll work together to create a buzz around this play and make it a hit. Trust me, I've got your back on this one.\"\nAmara Hartley: \"I appreciate your transparency, Mia. 20% of the net profits sounds like a fair deal, and I'm excited about the marketing campaign you're proposing. Just to clarify, would the $10,000 ad spend be in addition to the $35,000 upfront, or would it be deducted from the overall budget? I want to make sure we're clear on the financials before we finalize the deal.\"\nMia Davis: \"Good question, Amara! The $10,000 ad spend would be included in the overall budget, so we'd be looking at a total investment of $45,000.

I think it's a game-changer, and I've already had interest from a few producers, but I think your company would be the perfect fit.\"\nMiles Hawkins: \"That does sound incredible, Sophia.

How's the coding world treating you?\"\nEthan Smith: \"It's been good, just busy as usual. I heard you've been working on a play about your parents' life, how's that going?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Yeah, it's been a labor of love, but I've finally finished it! I think it's a really powerful story that needs to be told, and I'd love to discuss the possibility of your production company bringing it to life.\"\nEthan Smith: \"That's great to hear, I'd love to take a look at the script. What kind of production scale were you thinking of, a small intimate setting or a bigger, more elaborate show?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I was thinking of something in between, a medium-sized production that can still convey the emotional intimacy of the story, but also has the potential to reach a broader audience and spark some important conversations about social justice and environmental activism, which are central themes in the play.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I completely agree, those are really important themes that need to be shared with a wider audience. From a production standpoint, a medium-sized production would likely require a budget in the range of $50,000 to $100,000. Would you be open to negotiating the rights to the play within that range?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I appreciate your honesty about the budget, Ethan, but to be frank, I was thinking more in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 for the rights to the play. I believe the story has the potential to resonate with a huge audience and bring in significant revenue, and I want to make sure I'm fairly compensated for my work.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I understand where you're coming from, Benjamin, and I agree that the play has huge potential. However, I have to be realistic about my production company's budget for this season. Would you be willing to consider a profit-sharing model, where we could offer you a percentage of the profits instead of a flat fee, and potentially revisit the rights fee in the future if the play is a huge success?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I'm definitely open to considering a profit-sharing model, Ethan. However, I'd want to make sure the percentage of profits is substantial enough to reflect the value I believe the play brings to the production. Maybe we could discuss a 20-30% profit share, and also include a clause that revisits the rights fee if the play reaches certain box office milestones or wins any major awards?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want a significant percentage of profits, Benjamin. I could potentially do 20% profit share, but I'd need to cap the rights fee at $150,000. And I like the idea of revisiting the rights fee if the play reaches certain milestones or wins awards. Let me think for a moment... How about this: if the play wins a major award or reaches $1 million in box office sales, we revisit the rights fee and consider increasing it to $250,000?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"That's a interesting proposal, Ethan. I like the idea of a performance-based increase in the rights fee, but I'm not sure if $250,000 is enough considering the potential of the play. How about we meet in the middle at $300,000 if the play reaches those milestones? And what kind of major award are we talking about? A Tony, a Pulitzer, or something else?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want to aim high, Benjamin. Meeting in the middle at $300,000 is doable, but I need to make sure it's tied to a very specific achievement. How about this: if the play wins a Tony Award for Best Play or Best Director, or the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, we revisit the rights fee and increase it to $300,000. That way, we're both incentivized to make the play a huge success, and you'll be rewarded for your hard work if it reaches the highest levels of recognition.\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ethan, I think we've got a deal! I'm really happy with the terms, and I think this is a win-win for both of us. The Tony or Pulitzer trigger for the increased rights fee is perfect, and I'm confident that with your production company behind it, we can make this play a huge success.

I've been having the worst week, everything seems to be going wrong, have you ever had one of those weeks where you just feel like the universe is against you?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ugh, yeah, I've definitely had those weeks. What's been going on, maybe we can figure out what's behind this streak of bad luck?\"\nMia Davis: \"Well, it's just a series of weird coincidences, but I did recently acquire this... antique item, and ever since then, things have been going downhill. Do you believe in, you know, 'bad juju' or anything like that?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ha, well, I don't believe in bad juju, but I do believe in the power of our minds. If you think this item is causing bad luck, then maybe we can do something to, you know, 'cleanse' it of its negative energy?\"\nMia Davis: \"Oh, I don't know, I'm not sure it's just in my head... I mean, I've had some pretty rational people experience some weird stuff around me lately too. Maybe there's something to this 'bad juju' after all... Do you think it's possible that some objects can just be... tainted, or something?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Well, I think it's possible that our perceptions can be influenced by our surroundings, and if you're feeling like this object is having a negative impact, then maybe we can try to, you know,'reset' it or something. I've heard of people doing rituals to cleanse objects of negative energy, would you like to try something like that?\"\nMia Davis: \"A ritual, huh? I don't know... I've tried to shake this feeling off, but it's been going on for weeks. I'm starting to think that maybe it's not just about my perception... What if this object is actually cursed? Shouldn't we try to, I don't know, get rid of it or something?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I understand your concerns, but getting rid of the object might not be the most practical solution. How about this: we can try to do a ritual to break the curse, and if you still feel like the object is having a negative impact after that, then we can reconsider what to do with it.

Destroying the object might not be the answer, and it could be something that holds sentimental value to you. Let's take a step back, and try to approach this with a clear head.

I can see that you're really frustrated and scared, and I'm here for you. I'm not saying you're being impulsive, I just think that we should consider all our options before making a move. And I get it, you're skeptical about the ritual, but it's not going to hurt to try, right? It's not like we're going to make things worse by trying. Let's just take a deep breath, and think this through together, okay?\"\nMia Davis: \"Okay, okay... I'm sorry too. I just feel like I've tried everything and nothing's working. But... I guess you're right. It won't hurt to try. But if this ritual doesn't work, I'm getting rid of that thing, no matter what. And I don't want to hear about sentimental value or any of that nonsense. Deal?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Deal! I'm with you, Mia. We'll do this ritual, and if it doesn't work, we'll figure out what to do with the object together. I promise.

It's really comfortable, my wife and I have loved having it in our living room.\"\nWilliam Brown: \"Yeah, I've been looking for a comfortable couch set for my place, and yours sounds great! What makes you want to upgrade to a stiffer one, if I may ask?\"\nAva Martinez: \"Ah, yeah, my wife just wants a change of pace, you know? But honestly, this set is amazing, it's been the centerpiece of our living room for years, and we've had so many great memories on it. The comfort is just unbeatable!\"\nWilliam Brown: \"I totally get it, sometimes a change of pace is needed. I can imagine it's hard to let go of such a great set, especially with all the memories attached to it. So, you're looking to sell it for $550, right? Is there any room for negotiation on the price?\"\nAva Martinez: \"Yeah, that's the price we're thinking, but I'm open to reasonable offers. I mean, like I said, it's a great set, and we're not looking to give it away, but we're also motivated to sell. What did you have in mind?\"\nWilliam Brown: \"I totally understand, and I appreciate your honesty. To be frank, I was thinking more along the lines of $450, considering the light staining and all. But I have to say, you've really sold me on the comfort aspect, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to $475?\"\nAva Martinez: \"I appreciate your honesty too, and I understand where you're coming from. However, I've got to say, $475 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

I could maybe do $500, but that's as low as I can go.\"\nWilliam Brown: \"I understand your point about the staining, and I agree the comfort is a major selling point. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we split the difference between $475 and $500, and do $487.50?

However, I've got to be honest with you, $510 is still a bit above my budget. But I really do love the set, and I can see myself making many memories on it. Tell you what, I'll meet you at $505, and that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to shake on that?\"\nAva Martinez: \"You know, I've got to say, I'm really impressed with your negotiation skills! And I can tell you're a man who values comfort and making memories. You know what, I think we can make a deal at $505. I'll even throw in some free cleaning products to help you keep the set looking its best. What do you say, do we have a deal?\"\nWilliam Brown: \"Wow, I'm impressed too! I think we've had a great conversation, and I appreciate your willingness to listen to my offers. And the free cleaning products are a nice touch! You know what, I think we do have a deal at $505. I'm happy to take the set off your hands and make some new memories with it. Let's shake on it and finalize the details!\"\nAva Martinez: \"Ah, I'm so glad we could come to an agreement!
