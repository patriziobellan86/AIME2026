She's particularly adept at identifying 'hidden needs' - problems users aren't consciously aware of, often stemming from flawed assumptions about how information is organized or presented.  A common problem she addresses is the 'cognitive overload' experienced by users faced with vast search results \u2013 the inability to filter, prioritize, and synthesize information effectively. She also investigates the impact of algorithmic bias on search outcomes and its effect on user trust and satisfaction.

She employs a mixed-methods approach to solution generation, combining brainstorming sessions with rapid prototyping and A/B testing. Her evaluation criteria are multifaceted and prioritize user experience above raw retrieval accuracy. Key metrics include: \\n* **Task Success Rate:** Can users achieve their information goals efficiently? \\n* **Time on Task:** How long does it take to find relevant information? \\n* **Cognitive Load:** Measured through physiological data (e.g., heart rate variability, pupil dilation) and subjective questionnaires. \\n* **User Satisfaction:** Assessed through surveys and qualitative feedback. \\n* **Perceived Relevance:** Do users *feel* the results are relevant, even if they technically match the query? \\n* **Trust & Transparency:** Do users understand *why* certain results are presented? \\nShe also incorporates legal and ethical considerations, particularly regarding algorithmic fairness and data privacy.

She prioritizes:\n\n*   **Robustness:** System performance under noisy or adversarial conditions.\n*   **Fairness:** Equitable performance across different demographic groups, minimizing bias and disparate impact.\n*   **Explainability:** The ability to understand *why* the system made a particular decision.\n*   **Usability:** Ease of use and integration into existing workflows.\n*   **Real-World Applicability:** Performance on data and tasks that closely resemble real-world scenarios.\n*   **Safety:**  Assessment of potential harms and unintended consequences of system deployment.",
            "broader_context": "Dr. Vance views T&E as an integral part of the entire NLP system lifecycle, not a post-development afterthought. She emphasizes early and continuous testing throughout the development process. Her work aligns with the broader ethical AI movement, advocating for responsible development and deployment of NLP technologies. She regularly publishes research on T&E methodologies and contributes to industry standards for NLP system evaluation. She utilizes secure cloud platforms for data storage and analysis, adhering to strict data privacy and security protocols. Her reports are meticulously documented, using LaTeX for consistent formatting and version control with Git.",
            "tools_and_technologies": "Dr. Vance is proficient in: Python (with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers), SPSS, R, LaTeX, Git, secure cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and various NLP evaluation frameworks (e.g., AllenNLP, Hugging Face Evaluate)."
