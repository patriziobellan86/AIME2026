However, I have to say that I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $14,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to do the deal at that price, I'll consider it a fair transaction and we can shake on it.\"\nRafael Cortez: \"I appreciate your flexibility, Oliver. After careful consideration, I've decided that I'm willing to stretch a bit to meet you at $14,000. However, I have to admit that it's still a bit above my target price. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $13,800, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to accept that, I think we can both walk away from this deal feeling satisfied.\"\nOliver Thompson: \"Dr. Cortez, I have to say that I'm impressed by your negotiating skills! You've driven a hard bargain, and I respect that. After careful consideration, I've decided that $13,800 is a fair price for this beautiful antique chair. I'm willing to accept your final offer, and I think we can both walk away from this deal feeling satisfied. Let's shake on it and make it official!\"\nRafael Cortez: \"Excellent, Oliver! I'm glad we could come to a mutually agreeable price. I think $13,800 is a fair price for this stunning chair, and I'm excited to take it home. Let's shake on it and make it official!

I think we've had a great conversation, and I appreciate your willingness to listen to my offers. And the free cleaning products are a nice touch! You know what, I think we do have a deal at $505. I'm happy to take the set off your hands and make some new memories with it. Let's shake on it and finalize the details!\"\nAva Martinez: \"Ah, I'm so glad we could come to an agreement! I think you're going to love this set, and I'm happy to see it go to a good home. Let's shake on it and finalize the details! I'll even help you load it up and get it to your place.
