Growing up, I was always fascinated by my parents' journey, the struggles they faced, and the love they shared. I wanted to honor their memory by bringing their story to life on stage, and I believe it has the potential to resonate with audiences everywhere.\"\nNoah Davis: \"I can sense the passion and heart you've poured into this play, Finnegan - I'd love to read the script and discuss how we can bring it to life within our production company's means.\"\nFinnegan O'Malley: \"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Noah.

Let me be upfront with you, our budget for new plays this season is limited, but I believe in this project's potential. Can we talk about a tiered system, where the percentage of profits increases as the play's success grows?\"\nFinnegan O'Malley: \"A tiered system could be an interesting approach, Noah. I like the idea of incentivizing success, but I need to make sure I'm protected in case the play doesn't perform as well as we hope. Can we discuss some specific numbers, and perhaps a guaranteed minimum payment to ensure I'm not left with nothing if the play doesn't take off?\"\nNoah Davis: \"Absolutely, Finnegan - I understand your concerns. Let's talk about a guaranteed minimum payment of, say, $10,000 for the rights, and then we can structure the tiered system to kick in once the play reaches certain revenue milestones. For example, we could offer 5% of profits up to $500,000, 7% from $500,000 to $1 million, and 10% above that. What are your thoughts on that?\"\nFinnegan O'Malley: \"Noah, I think you're getting close to a proposal that I can live with. The guaranteed minimum payment of $10,000 is a good starting point, and the tiered system you've outlined is reasonable. However, I was thinking more along the lines of 8% from $500,000 to $1 million, and 12% above that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway on that?\"\nNoah Davis: \"Finnegan, I like your style - you're a shrewd negotiator! I can see that we're close to a deal. I can meet you halfway on the percentages, so 9% from $500,000 to $1 million, and 11% above that. But I need to ensure that our production company can still make a profit.

As a police officer, I've seen firsthand the impact that their programs have on our community, especially when it comes to supporting victims of crime.\"\nEli Dawson: \"That's wonderful to hear, Officer.

How's the coding world treating you?\"\nEthan Smith: \"It's been good, just busy as usual. I heard you've been working on a play about your parents' life, how's that going?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Yeah, it's been a labor of love, but I've finally finished it! I think it's a really powerful story that needs to be told, and I'd love to discuss the possibility of your production company bringing it to life.\"\nEthan Smith: \"That's great to hear, I'd love to take a look at the script. What kind of production scale were you thinking of, a small intimate setting or a bigger, more elaborate show?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I was thinking of something in between, a medium-sized production that can still convey the emotional intimacy of the story, but also has the potential to reach a broader audience and spark some important conversations about social justice and environmental activism, which are central themes in the play.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I completely agree, those are really important themes that need to be shared with a wider audience. From a production standpoint, a medium-sized production would likely require a budget in the range of $50,000 to $100,000. Would you be open to negotiating the rights to the play within that range?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I appreciate your honesty about the budget, Ethan, but to be frank, I was thinking more in the range of $200,000 to $300,000 for the rights to the play. I believe the story has the potential to resonate with a huge audience and bring in significant revenue, and I want to make sure I'm fairly compensated for my work.\"\nEthan Smith: \"I understand where you're coming from, Benjamin, and I agree that the play has huge potential. However, I have to be realistic about my production company's budget for this season. Would you be willing to consider a profit-sharing model, where we could offer you a percentage of the profits instead of a flat fee, and potentially revisit the rights fee in the future if the play is a huge success?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"I'm definitely open to considering a profit-sharing model, Ethan. However, I'd want to make sure the percentage of profits is substantial enough to reflect the value I believe the play brings to the production. Maybe we could discuss a 20-30% profit share, and also include a clause that revisits the rights fee if the play reaches certain box office milestones or wins any major awards?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want a significant percentage of profits, Benjamin. I could potentially do 20% profit share, but I'd need to cap the rights fee at $150,000. And I like the idea of revisiting the rights fee if the play reaches certain milestones or wins awards. Let me think for a moment... How about this: if the play wins a major award or reaches $1 million in box office sales, we revisit the rights fee and consider increasing it to $250,000?\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"That's a interesting proposal, Ethan. I like the idea of a performance-based increase in the rights fee, but I'm not sure if $250,000 is enough considering the potential of the play. How about we meet in the middle at $300,000 if the play reaches those milestones? And what kind of major award are we talking about? A Tony, a Pulitzer, or something else?\"\nEthan Smith: \"I can see why you'd want to aim high, Benjamin. Meeting in the middle at $300,000 is doable, but I need to make sure it's tied to a very specific achievement. How about this: if the play wins a Tony Award for Best Play or Best Director, or the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, we revisit the rights fee and increase it to $300,000. That way, we're both incentivized to make the play a huge success, and you'll be rewarded for your hard work if it reaches the highest levels of recognition.\"\nBenjamin Jackson: \"Ethan, I think we've got a deal! I'm really happy with the terms, and I think this is a win-win for both of us. The Tony or Pulitzer trigger for the increased rights fee is perfect, and I'm confident that with your production company behind it, we can make this play a huge success.
