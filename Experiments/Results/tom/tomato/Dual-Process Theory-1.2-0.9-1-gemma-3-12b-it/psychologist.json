This rapid, automatic assessment allows her to build rapport quickly, often establishing a sense of trust before conscious verbal communication is extensive. Years of experience have honed this System 1 processing, creating a vast network of mental shortcuts and pattern recognition abilities. When encountering a new client, she doesn't begin with a rigid diagnostic framework but rather with a felt sense \u2013 a gut reaction \u2013 about their core struggles and potential pathways to healing.

This manifests in her meticulous case documentation, where she systematically explores client narratives, cross-referencing them with established psychological theories (primarily Attachment Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). Her diagnostic assessments are thorough, utilizing standardized instruments to validate or challenge her initial impressions.

She encourages clients to critically examine their thoughts and behaviors, challenging automatic negative patterns.

Dr. Vance's ability to seamlessly shift between these two systems allows her to tailor her approach to each client\u2019s individual needs, providing both immediate emotional support and long-term cognitive change. She frequently utilizes metacognitive strategies, prompting clients to become aware of their own thinking processes \u2013 recognizing when they are operating from System 1 versus System 2 \u2013 and to consciously regulate their cognitive responses.
