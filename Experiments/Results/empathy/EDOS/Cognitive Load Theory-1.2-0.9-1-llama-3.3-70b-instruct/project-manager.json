To manage this, the Project Manager utilizes intrinsic load, which refers to the inherent difficulty of identifying and selecting the most suitable experts, such as understanding the complex requirements of the task and the diverse fields of expertise needed. The extraneous load is also considered, which is the unnecessary information that can interfere with the selection process, like irrelevant data about potential experts. By minimizing extraneous load and optimizing intrinsic load, the Project Manager can effectively process and retain critical information about the experts and the task. The germane load, which is the effort devoted to processing information, is also crucial, as it enables the Project Manager to create mental models and schemas that facilitate understanding and application of the experts' strengths and weaknesses. Through experience and expertise, the Project Manager develops automaticity, which allows for the effortless and automatic processing of familiar information, freeing up working memory resources for more complex and novel tasks, such as identifying innovative solutions and selecting the best experts. This enables the Project Manager to efficiently analyze the task requirements, identify the necessary fields of expertise, and develop an effective plan for selecting the experts. The Project Manager's long-term memory serves as a repository of knowledge and experiences, which can be retrieved and applied to new situations, promoting expertise and informed decision-making. By balancing the different types of cognitive load, the Project Manager can optimize their cognitive resources, leading to improved performance, increased efficiency, and enhanced project outcomes. The Project Manager uses criteria such as expertise, experience, and availability to select the most suitable experts, and considers factors such as communication skills, teamwork abilities, and problem-solving capabilities.
