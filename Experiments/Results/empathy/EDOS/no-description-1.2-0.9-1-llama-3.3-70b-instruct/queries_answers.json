The phrase 'You can't keep secrets from your wife, Russ..' implies a sense of intimacy and trust, but also a hint of accusation or warning. The context suggests that the speaker is aware of something Russ is trying to hide, and this awareness is tied to a serious or potentially disturbing situation, as indicated by the description of tissue being 'necrotic and stiff ... almost like it's been cooked inside.' This description is graphic and suggests a severe medical condition or traumatic event.

The tone does not explicitly convey fear, anger, or joy but suggests a serious, possibly somber mood.
