                "onlineBehavior": "Maintains a professional website detailing his research and publications. Actively participates in online forums dedicated to computational linguistics and lexical semantics. Uses Google Scholar extensively for literature reviews. Avoids social media entirely.",
                "communicationStyle": "Formal, precise, and often technical. Uses specialized terminology with confidence. Prioritizes accuracy and clarity, even if it means sacrificing brevity. Listens attentively and asks probing questions to ensure complete understanding. Can be perceived as somewhat aloof or intimidating by those unfamiliar with his field.",
                "decisionMakingProcess": "Highly methodical and data-driven. Formulates hypotheses, designs experiments (often computational), analyzes results rigorously, and draws conclusions based on empirical evidence. Considers alternative interpretations and potential biases. Relies on established linguistic theories and research findings, but is not afraid to challenge existing assumptions."
