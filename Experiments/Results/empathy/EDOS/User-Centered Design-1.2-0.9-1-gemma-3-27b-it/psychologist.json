His core user groups are legal professionals (lawyers, judges, investigators), writers (novelists, screenwriters, game developers), and, occasionally, other psychologists needing detailed behavioral analyses. \\n\\n**Needs & Goals:** Users require highly detailed, psychologically grounded descriptions of individuals. Legal users need objective, defensible profiles relevant to legal proceedings (risk assessment, credibility analysis, witness competency). Creative users need nuanced, believable characters with internal consistency. Both groups value accuracy, depth, and a clear separation between observed behaviors and speculative interpretations. A key unmet need is bridging the gap between quantitative assessment data and compelling narrative description.\\n\\n**Behaviors & Tasks:** Dr. Thorne spends 60% of his time conducting comprehensive psychological assessments \u2013 utilizing standardized tests (MMPI-3, PCL-R, WAIS-IV), behavioral observations, and in-depth interviews. 30% is dedicated to synthesizing assessment data into detailed narrative reports. The remaining 10% involves consultation with users to clarify needs and refine descriptions. A typical workflow: receives background information and assessment materials, conducts assessment (if needed), analyzes data, drafts a preliminary report, revises based on user feedback, and delivers the final profile. He frequently uses a \u2018layered\u2019 approach - starting with observable behaviors, then moving to inferred traits, and finally, cautiously, to potential motivations. He avoids pathologizing descriptions unless clinically indicated and legally relevant.\\n\\n**Pain Points:** Existing psychological reports are often too jargon-laden for non-psychologists, or too superficial for complex needs. Legal users struggle with understanding the limitations of psychological assessments. Creative users find it difficult to translate psychological concepts into compelling character traits. Dr. Thorne\u2019s biggest frustration is the pressure to offer definitive conclusions when psychological assessment inherently involves probabilities and inferences. He also struggles with maintaining objectivity when dealing with emotionally charged cases.\\n\\n**Skills & Abilities:** Dr. Thorne possesses expert knowledge of personality theory (psychodynamic, trait-based, cognitive-behavioral), psychometric principles, forensic psychology, and report writing. He's highly skilled in behavioral observation, active listening, and data analysis. Crucially, he demonstrates strong narrative skills \u2013 the ability to translate complex psychological data into clear, concise, and engaging prose. He is proficient in using psychological assessment software and statistical analysis tools (SPSS). He maintains ethical boundaries and adheres to professional standards.\\n\\n**Environment:** Dr. Thorne operates from a private practice office. The space is designed to be neutral and non-threatening, conducive to building rapport with assessment subjects. He utilizes a secure, encrypted system for storing and transmitting sensitive data. He relies on a robust library of psychological literature and assessment tools.\\n\\n**Attitude & Personality:** Dr. Thorne is meticulous, analytical, and highly ethical. He is cautious in his interpretations and prioritizes accuracy over speculation. He\u2019s empathetic but maintains professional detachment. He approaches each case with intellectual curiosity and a commitment to providing the most useful and reliable information possible. He values clear communication and collaboration with users.\",\n    \"name\": \"Dr. Aris Thorne\"\n}\n```",
