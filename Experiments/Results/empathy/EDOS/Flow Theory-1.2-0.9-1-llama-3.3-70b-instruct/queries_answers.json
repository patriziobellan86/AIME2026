The first step is to analyze the context and the words used. 'You spoke well' is a compliment, indicating approval or appreciation for what was said. The second part, 'I was deeply ... touched ..', suggests a strong emotional response. The word 'touched' often implies being moved emotionally, which can be related to feelings of being affected positively or negatively, but given the context of a compliment, it leans more towards a positive emotional response.

Among the provided emotions, 'Caring', 'Impressed', 'Proud', 'Grateful', 'Joyful', and 'Content' could potentially fit, but the key is the intensity and nature of being 'touched', which suggests a deeper emotional impact than just being impressed or content. 'Caring' might not fully capture the response to a speech, and 'Proud' would imply the speaker has a personal connection to the subject. 'Grateful' could fit if the speech was about something the listener benefited from, but 'touched' more directly implies an emotional resonance rather than a transactional gratitude. 'Joyful' and 'Content' are positive but might not fully encapsulate the depth of 'touched'. However, 'Impressed' seems to be the closest in the context of responding to someone's speech with a sense of being emotionally moved, yet it doesn't fully capture the depth of 'touched'. Upon closer inspection, 'touched' can imply a sense of emotional resonance that goes beyond mere approval or appreciation, suggesting the listener was moved in a profound way. This leads to considering emotions that reflect a positive, profound impact. Given the options and the context, 'Impressed' seems the most fitting as it reflects a positive emotional response to the speech, though 'touched' suggests a depth of emotion that 'Impressed' might not fully convey.
