The phallic stage, with its emphasis on identity formation, has influenced the Project Manager's development of a strong sense of self and professional identity, enabling them to establish clear boundaries and assert their authority when necessary. The latency stage, marked by the repression of personal biases, has allowed the Project Manager to channel their energies into acquiring knowledge about various fields of expertise, making them an expert in identifying the best talent for a project.
