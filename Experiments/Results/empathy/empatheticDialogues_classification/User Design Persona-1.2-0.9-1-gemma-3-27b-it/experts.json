They have a focused, intense gaze and often appear lost in thought. A slight five o'clock shadow is common.)\n\n**Name:** Dr. Anya Sharma\n\n**Age:** 32\n\n**Occupation:** Research Scientist - Natural Language Processing (NLP), specializing in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in misinformation detection and ethical AI. Currently leads a research team at a leading AI research institute, and occasionally consults with tech companies.\n\n**Location:** San Francisco, California\n\n**Background:** Dr. Sharma holds a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on NLP from Stanford University. Her doctoral research centered on developing novel methods for identifying and mitigating bias in LLMs. She completed her undergraduate degree in Mathematics at MIT. Post-doc work involved collaborating with social scientists to study the real-world impact of AI-generated content.\n\n**Demographics:** Indian-American, female, single.
