The therapeutic relationship is seen as a microcosm of the patient\u2019s external environment, providing a setting for the exploration of environmental influences on behavior. This professional understands that behaviors are often the result of a complex interplay between the organism and its environment, striving to mediate between these forces and the behavioral outcomes.\n\n    The Behavioral Analyst\u2019s work focuses on facilitating the patient\u2019s journey towards understanding and modifying their behaviors through the application of evidence-based behavioral interventions.
