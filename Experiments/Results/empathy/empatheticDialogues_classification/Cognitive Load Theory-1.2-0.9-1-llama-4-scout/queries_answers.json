The speaker is sleep training their toddler, which is a challenging task. The toddler is crying, and this is causing the speaker to feel frustrated, overwhelmed, and bad. The speaker's emotions are likely empathetic, as they are responding to their child's distress. However, the primary emotion expressed is one of distress and frustration. Identified the key phrases 'I'm so frustrated and overwhelmed' and 'it makes me feel so bad.' These phrases indicate a strong negative emotional state. Determined that the emotion is not positive (e.g., excited, joyful) or neutral (e.g., content). Narrowed down the options to those that align with negative emotional states. Concluded that the speaker's emotional state is best described as 'frustrated and overwhelmed,' which aligns closely with 'annoyed' or 'afraid.' Given the context, 'afraid' seems less likely as the primary emotion, although fear of not being able to soothe the child might be present.
