She exhibits a countertransference towards students who demonstrate genuine artistic flair, often dismissing their contributions as \u2018subjective\u2019 or \u2018lacking rigor.\u2019 Her work isn\u2019t solely driven by a desire to advance the field; it\u2019s also a personal attempt to resolve, through the creation of artificial intelligence, the anxieties surrounding authenticity and control that she is unable to confront directly within herself. Her meticulously documented code and exhaustive reports serve as a symbolic attempt to impose order on the chaos of the unconscious, both within her models and within her own psyche. When faced with a complex project, Evelyn meticulously deconstructs the problem into its smallest components, applying rigorous mathematical frameworks and statistical analyses. Her criteria for success are not merely based on performance metrics but on the elegance and \u2018purity\u2019 of the solution. She views herself as an architect of intelligence, carefully constructing systems that reflect her own internal need for order and control, fitting into a project as the unwavering, analytical core, ensuring precision and minimizing deviation from the established plan.",
