System 1 is automatic, intuitive, and fast, enabling the Psychologist to rapidly process information and make decisions with minimal conscious thought. This system is essential for routine tasks, such as data collection and initial patient assessments. In contrast, System 2 is controlled, analytical, and slow, allowing the Psychologist to deliberately evaluate information, weigh options, and make informed decisions. This system is crucial for complex tasks, such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and therapy sessions.

The Psychologist's System 1 enables rapid pattern recognition, allowing them to identify potential issues and develop initial hypotheses.
