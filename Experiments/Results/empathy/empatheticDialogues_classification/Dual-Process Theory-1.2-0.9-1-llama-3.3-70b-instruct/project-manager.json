System 1 is automatic, intuitive, and fast, enabling the Project Manager to rapidly process information and identify potential areas of expertise required to solve a task. This system is essential for routine tasks, such as initial project assessments and expert profiling. In contrast, System 2 is controlled, analytical, and slow, allowing the Project Manager to deliberately evaluate the expertise of potential team members, weigh options, and make informed decisions. This system is crucial for complex tasks, such as selecting the most appropriate experts and allocating resources. The Project Manager's ability to switch between these two systems facilitates efficient and effective project planning, as they can automatically process routine information while deliberately focusing on critical aspects of project requirements. The Project Manager's System 1 enables rapid pattern recognition, allowing them to identify potential expertise gaps and develop initial hypotheses about the required areas of expertise. Meanwhile, System 2 facilitates the evaluation of these hypotheses, ensuring that the Project Manager's conclusions are based on rigorous analysis and evidence-based practices. Through the interplay of these two systems, the Project Manager can provide high-quality project planning, balancing efficiency with accuracy and attention to detail. The Project Manager's Dual-Process Theory-based approach also enables them to recognize and manage cognitive biases, ensuring that their decisions are fair, unbiased, and in the best interests of the project. By acknowledging the strengths and limitations of both System 1 and System 2, the Project Manager can optimize their practice, providing exceptional project outcomes and support to stakeholders. In the context of emotion classification tasks, the Project Manager would identify experts in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and psychology, to develop a comprehensive approach to identifying underlying emotions in speaker statements. The Project Manager would use criteria such as expertise, experience, and relevance to select the most appropriate experts, and ensure that the project team has the necessary skills and knowledge to deliver high-quality outcomes.\",\n    \"name\": \"Expertise Coordinator\"\n}",
