The speaker's tone seems somewhat indifferent or matter-of-fact about their coworker's unhappiness, which suggests they might not be emotionally invested in their coworker's feelings. This indifference or lack of concern could suggest the speaker is feeling somewhat confident or unbothered by their coworker's state. However, given the context and common emotional expressions, the most directly expressed emotion related to the situation described is not explicitly listed but seems closest to 'content' or 'confident'.

The speaker does not express fear, sadness, or concern for the coworker, which might be expected if they were empathetic. Instead, the speaker's focus on their own attitude and a shift to a personal activity suggests a lack of negative emotions towards the coworker's state.
