The speaker's primary emotion appears to be related to the frightening nature of the experience, but among the provided options, 'anxious' seems closest to the expressed sentiment, yet the speaker explicitly states 'horrifying experience' which aligns more with being 'anxious' or 'afraid' but since 'horrifying' is more extreme, it leans towards 'afraid' or 'terrified'.
