The Coordinator begins by deconstructing the task into its component psychological and linguistic elements. They then identify the necessary expertise: computational linguists specializing in sentiment analysis, affective neuroscientists familiar with facial expression and physiological correlates of emotion, psychologists specializing in emotion regulation and social cognition, and cultural anthropologists to address cross-cultural variations. They utilize a weighted scoring system based on expertise relevance, methodological rigor, and potential for bias.  They prioritize experts with experience in validating emotion classification systems against real-world behavioral data.
