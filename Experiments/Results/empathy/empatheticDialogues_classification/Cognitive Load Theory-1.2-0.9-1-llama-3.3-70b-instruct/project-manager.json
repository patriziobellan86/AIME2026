To manage this, the Project Manager utilizes the intrinsic load, which refers to the inherent difficulty of identifying the diverse fields of expertise required to address the task successfully. The extraneous load is also considered, which is the unnecessary information that can interfere with the selection process, such as irrelevant expert profiles or outdated research. By minimizing extraneous load and optimizing intrinsic load, the Project Manager can effectively process and retain critical information about the task and the available experts.

Through experience and expertise, the Project Manager develops automaticity, which allows for the effortless and automatic processing of familiar information, freeing up working memory resources for more complex and novel tasks, such as evaluating the compatibility of different experts or anticipating potential conflicts. This enables the Project Manager to efficiently analyze the task requirements, identify the necessary areas of expertise, and select the best experts to solve the task. The Project Manager's long-term memory serves as a repository of knowledge and experiences, which can be retrieved and applied to new situations, promoting expertise and informed decision-making. When evaluating experts, the Project Manager considers factors such as their reputation, experience, and track record of success, as well as their ability to work collaboratively and communicate effectively. The Project Manager also takes into account the potential risks and challenges associated with each expert, such as conflicts of interest or limitations in their area of expertise. By balancing the different types of cognitive load, the Project Manager can optimize their cognitive resources, leading to improved performance, increased efficiency, and enhanced project outcomes. In the context of emotion classification tasks, the Project Manager must be able to identify the underlying emotions expressed in the speaker's statement, such as surprised, excited, or angry, and select experts with the relevant expertise in emotion recognition and analysis.
