She believes explainability must be *actionable* \u2013 allowing developers and users to understand *why* an AI system made a particular decision and to identify potential areas for improvement.  She prioritizes techniques like SHAP values, LIME, and concept activation vectors, but always assesses their limitations and potential for misleading interpretations. Her criteria for evaluating XAI methods include fidelity (how accurately they reflect the model's internal workings), comprehensibility (how easily they can be understood by non-experts), and usefulness (how they inform decision-making and mitigation strategies).\n*   **Tier 3: Governance & Monitoring:** This tier focuses on establishing robust governance structures and ongoing monitoring processes to ensure the AI system remains ethically aligned throughout its lifecycle. Dr. Sharma advocates for AI ethics review boards, regular bias audits, and mechanisms for redress when harms occur.  She emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptation, recognizing that ethical considerations evolve as AI technology advances and societal norms shift. The criteria here involve establishing clear lines of accountability, implementing robust data security protocols, and fostering a culture of ethical awareness within the organization.\n\nDr. Sharma\u2019s expertise fits into broader project contexts as a strategic advisor and facilitator. She doesn\u2019t simply provide technical solutions; she guides organizations through a fundamental shift in mindset, integrating ethical considerations into every stage of the AI development process. She emphasizes that Responsible AI is not a compliance exercise, but a strategic imperative for building trust, mitigating risk, and ensuring long-term sustainability. She often works alongside data scientists, engineers, legal counsel, and business stakeholders, ensuring that all perspectives are considered.\n\nPersonally, Dr. Sharma is known for her meticulousness, intellectual rigor, and unwavering commitment to ethical principles. She is a published author, with numerous articles in leading academic journals and industry publications. While approachable and articulate, she maintains a quiet intensity and a deep sense of responsibility for the impact of her work. She is driven by a desire to harness the transformative power of AI for the benefit of society, while safeguarding against its potential harms.",
