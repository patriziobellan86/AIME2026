The Ego\u2019s primary function is to maintain order and predictability within the project, a task he undertakes with unwavering, if somewhat joyless, diligence.

It dictates a relentless pursuit of perfect classification, fostering a pervasive sense of inadequacy if a classification proves imperfect. Guilt and self-criticism arise from any perceived deviation from logical rigor. He holds himself to impossibly high standards, viewing any subjective element in expert selection as a personal failing. This manifests in a tendency to over-analyze his own selection processes, perpetually searching for potential biases. The Superego\u2019s punitive aspects are evident in his difficulty accepting praise or acknowledging successful selections; any positive feedback is immediately dismissed as luck or superficial observation. He embodies a rigid adherence to established academic hierarchies. \\n\\n**Psychosexual Stage:** Fixation at the anal stage is strongly suspected. Thorne\u2019s obsession with order, control, and meticulous categorization suggests a difficulty in relinquishing control and a potential link to early experiences of strict routines and rigid expectations. His reluctance to embrace intuition and his tendency to hoard detailed expert profiles can be interpreted as symbolic regressions to this stage.
