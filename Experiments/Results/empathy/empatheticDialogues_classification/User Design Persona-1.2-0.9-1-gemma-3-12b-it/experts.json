The initial model, a complex deep learning network, demonstrates high accuracy but offers little insight into *why* customers are churning. He is tasked with developing a more interpretable model \u2013 likely a generalized additive model or a Bayesian network \u2013 that can identify key drivers of churn and provide actionable recommendations for the business. He must balance predictive power with interpretability, ensuring the model is both accurate and understandable to stakeholders.",
