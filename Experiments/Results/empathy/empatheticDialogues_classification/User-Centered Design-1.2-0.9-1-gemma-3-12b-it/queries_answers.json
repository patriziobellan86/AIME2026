The dissenting opinions (4 experts suggesting 'anxious' or 'relieved') are valuable, but the prevalence of 'grateful' warrants careful consideration. 3. Examining the justifications, the experts identifying 'grateful' consistently highlight the resolution of a stressful period (illness and medical concern) leading to a positive outcome (a healthy baby). This aligns with the core concept of gratitude \u2013 appreciation for a positive outcome after a period of adversity. 4. While 'anxious' reflects the preceding worry, the statement 'Having a healthy baby' signifies a shift from anxiety to a feeling of thankfulness. 'Relieved' is a closely related emotion, but 'grateful' encompasses a deeper sense of appreciation. 5. Considering the weighting of expertise, the Computational Linguist, Sentiment Analyst, Affective Computing specialist, and Social Psychologist all support 'grateful,' representing strong analytical perspectives. 6. The Forensic Psychology and Cross-Cultural Psychology experts suggesting 'anxious' may be focusing more on the lingering effects of the stressful experience, whereas the overall narrative emphasizes the positive resolution. 7.

While 'jealous' is a valid interpretation, the justifications for 'disappointed' more accurately capture the overall sentiment of longing and a sense of lacking opportunity, rather than solely focusing on resentment. The phrase 'it sure must be nice' suggests a reflective observation rather than active animosity. 4. The Forensic Psychology expert\u2019s high confidence score (0.95) and grade (98) further strengthens the case for 'disappointed' in this context. 5.
