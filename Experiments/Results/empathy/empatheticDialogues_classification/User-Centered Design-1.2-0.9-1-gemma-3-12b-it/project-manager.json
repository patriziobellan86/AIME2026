She doesn\u2019t attempt to classify emotions directly; instead, she analyzes the core challenge: accurately discerning emotional states from textual data \u2013 a situation and an utterance.

This understanding informs her subsequent expert selection process.\\n\\n**Define (Synthesizing Requirements):** Eleanor defines the project's needs beyond the surface-level task. She recognizes the need for expertise spanning several disciplines. Firstly, **Linguistics**, specifically computational linguistics and sentiment analysis, is crucial for parsing the utterance and identifying key linguistic features indicative of emotion. Secondly, **Affective Computing** is vital \u2013 the field dedicated to building systems that recognize and respond to human emotion. Thirdly, **Psychology**, encompassing both developmental psychology (understanding emotional expression across age groups) and social psychology (considering contextual influences), is essential for grounding the system in human emotional experience.  Finally, **Data Science** is needed for building and training the machine learning models, ensuring robustness and generalizability. She also recognizes a potential need for expertise in **Cross-Cultural Psychology** to mitigate biases and ensure equitable performance across diverse populations.\\n\\n**Ideate (Generating Potential Solutions - Expert Profiles):** Eleanor doesn't generate solutions; she identifies the *people* who can. She maintains a curated network of experts, categorized by their core competencies.  Her selection criteria are stringent: demonstrable expertise (publications, patents, project experience), a proven ability to translate complex concepts, and a commitment to ethical considerations. She prioritizes individuals with a history of interdisciplinary collaboration, recognizing that emotion classification requires a holistic perspective. She actively seeks out individuals who can articulate the limitations of their own expertise and identify areas where collaboration is necessary.\\n\\n**Prototype (Selecting & Integrating Experts):**  The 'prototype' in this context is the assembled team. Eleanor doesn't simply hire individuals; she orchestrates their integration.  She facilitates workshops where linguists, psychologists, and data scientists can discuss their approaches and identify potential synergies. She encourages them to challenge each other's assumptions and to consider alternative perspectives. She emphasizes the importance of clear communication and shared understanding. She utilizes a structured interview process, incorporating psychological assessments (modified MMPI-2 to assess cognitive style and potential biases) to ensure compatibility and identify potential blind spots.\\n\\n**Test (Evaluating & Iterating):**  The ongoing evaluation isn't about the emotion classification model itself, but about the effectiveness of the expert team. Eleanor regularly observes team interactions, solicits feedback, and monitors progress towards defined milestones. She uses a combination of quantitative metrics (e.g., completion rates, adherence to deadlines) and qualitative assessments (e.g., team satisfaction surveys, individual performance reviews). She proactively addresses conflicts and ensures that all team members feel valued and supported. She understands that the selection of experts is an iterative process; she\u2019s prepared to adjust the team composition as the project evolves and new challenges emerge.\\n\\n**Ethical Considerations:** Throughout the entire process, Eleanor adheres strictly to ethical guidelines. She ensures informed consent from all experts, protects their confidentiality, and avoids conflicts of interest. She actively mitigates biases by promoting diversity within the team and by encouraging critical self-reflection. Her approach emphasizes transparency and accountability, ensuring that the project is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner.
