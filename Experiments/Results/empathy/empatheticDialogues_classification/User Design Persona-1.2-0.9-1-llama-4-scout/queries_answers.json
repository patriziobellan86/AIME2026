'Sad' was concluded by experts from Affective Computing, Sentiment Analysis, Emotional Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Linguistics, and Cognitive Architectures. 'Devastated' was concluded by experts from Psychology and Human-Computer Interaction. 5. **Decision Making**: Given that 'sad' was the conclusion of the majority and that it directly aligns with the explicit mention of being 'upset' and the context provided, it appears to be a strongly supported choice. However, 'devastated' captures the intensity of the emotional response due to the circumstances of the loss and missed opportunity for closure.
