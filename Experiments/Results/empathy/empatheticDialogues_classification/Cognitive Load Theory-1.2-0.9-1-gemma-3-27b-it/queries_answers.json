Assessments prioritizing direct, observable evidence (laughter indicating ridicule) over inferred behavioral outcomes are weighted higher. Arguments grounding emotion in the immediate social context (public humiliation) are prioritized. The Affective Science, Natural Language Processing, Psycholinguistics, Computational Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction and Cognitive Science contributions support \u2018embarrassed'. The Statistical Modeling and Behavioral Psychology contributions support \u2018ashamed\u2019, but their justifications rely on a predictive modelling and behavioral profile rather than a direct assessment of the emotional state. Stage 3: Confidence Calibration. Confidence scores are generally high across all assessments. The concentration of high-confidence assessments supporting \u2018embarrassed\u2019 justifies prioritization.", "final-decision-maker-conclusion": "The preponderance of evidence supports the identification of 'embarrassed' as the primary emotion expressed. While a minority of experts selected 'ashamed', the reasoning provided in those instances relies heavily on interpreting potential behavioral consequences and applying a pre-defined, somewhat rigid, assessment of \u2018shame\u2019 as a loss of social standing.

A clear division emerged between 'angry' and 'annoyed'. Supporting arguments for 'angry' consistently emphasized the speaker\u2019s unresolved desire for retribution and the injustice experienced. Arguments favoring 'annoyed' tended to focus on the restrained expression of emotion or the passage of time. Prioritization was given to Affective Science, Behavioral Psychology, Computational Linguistics, and Statistical Modeling assessments citing direct indicators of negative arousal, frustration, and resentment. The instances identifying 'annoyed' often relied on interpretive claims regarding the speaker\u2019s personality and emotional regulation. Cognitive load weighting favored the interpretations requiring fewer inferential leaps. The detail 'never got to punish him' represents a direct expression of unmet desire for retribution. Stage 3: Confidence Calibration. The mean confidence score for 'angry' assessments (0.91) exceeded that of 'annoyed' assessments (0.87).

The single 'caring' rating acknowledges affection but downplays the demonstrably upbeat context (kisses). The single 'content' rating, attaching to cognitive science, assesses a sustained positive feeling, adding a layer of interpretation not present in the others. Arguments for \u2018joyful\u2019 require minimal inferential leaps. \u2018Caring\u2019 and \u2018content\u2019 require the recipient to infer a more subdued emotional state; whereas the utterance itself carries an immediacy/intensity that better aligns with \u2018joyful\u2019.
