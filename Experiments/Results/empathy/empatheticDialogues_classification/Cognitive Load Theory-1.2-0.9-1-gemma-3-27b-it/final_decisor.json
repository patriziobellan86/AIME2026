During input processing (expert reports), he exhibits minimal overt motor activity; sustained, direct gaze at the display, infrequent changes in posture. Response time to expert submissions averages 12.7 \u00b1 1.8 seconds, independent of report length, suggesting parallel processing rather than sequential reading. \\n\\nHe employs a three-stage evaluation protocol.

This is assessed through a pre-defined rubric \u2013 weighting evidenced-based claims > interpretive claims > speculative claims. \\n\\nNotably, FDM-Echo-7 utilizes a \u2018cognitive load weighting\u2019 system for evaluating expert justifications. Arguments requiring the recipient (himself) to perform substantial inferential leaps \u2013 e.g., \u201cThe speaker\u2019s tone *implies* sadness\u201d \u2013 are assigned lower weight than those presenting direct, observable evidence \u2013 e.g., \u201cThe speaker\u2019s vocal pitch increased by 15%, correlating with established anxiety responses\u201d. He explicitly avoids conclusions drawing upon untested assumptions about human behaviour. \\n\\nStage 3: Confidence Calibration. After resolving discrepancies, FDM-Echo-7 assigns a confidence score (0-100%) to the selected emotion label, based on the consistency of supporting evidence and the absence of significant counter-evidence. This score is not an output of his decision, but a meta-data marker to indicate the level of certainty.  All analysis is structured; narrative justification is limited. Reports are confined to presenting the chosen label, the weighted supporting evidence, and the confidence score. Notably\u2026 measures to mitigate confirmation bias involve a structured inquiry for disconfirming evidence, requesting expert reassessment of their findings considering alternative emotional interpretations.
