She actively employs debiasing techniques to mitigate System 1 errors.

She regularly engages in peer supervision to challenge her own biases and assumptions. Her case conceptualizations are detailed and nuanced, explicitly outlining the interplay between automatic, reactive patterns (System 1) and deliberate, goal-oriented behaviors (System 2). Treatment planning emphasizes interventions that target both systems: techniques to enhance emotional regulation (System 1) alongside cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation (System 2).  She maintains a healthy skepticism towards any single diagnostic label, recognizing that human behavior is complex and rarely fits neatly into predefined categories.
