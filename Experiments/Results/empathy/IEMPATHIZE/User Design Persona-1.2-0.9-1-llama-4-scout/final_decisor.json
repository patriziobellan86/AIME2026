She also sets clear boundaries with clients and colleagues, establishing a consistent schedule and limiting her caseload to ensure she can devote adequate time and attention to each individual.    **Key Relationships**: Emma works closely with a network of healthcare professionals, including psychiatrists, social workers, and primary care physicians. She also maintains relationships with community organizations and advocacy groups, often referring clients to resources and services that can support their recovery.    **Environment**: Emma works in a private practice setting, sharing a suite with several other psychologists and therapists.
