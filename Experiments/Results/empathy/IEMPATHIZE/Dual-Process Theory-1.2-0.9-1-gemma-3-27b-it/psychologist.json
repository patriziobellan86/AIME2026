Initial impressions are deliberately minimized; she avoids rapid, intuitive judgments, recognizing their potential for bias. Instead, her process begins with extensive data gathering \u2013 thorough review of background information (records, reports, previous assessments), followed by a highly structured interview protocol. This protocol isn\u2019t rigidly adhered to, but serves as a framework to ensure comprehensive exploration of key domains: biographical details, current functioning (emotional, cognitive, behavioral, social), history of presenting concerns, and relevant life events. Observation is deliberate and focused, cataloging verbal and non-verbal cues, but interpreted only after collation with other data. \\n\\nHer System 2 dominance isn't absolute. A fast, System 1 response initially registers basic demographic information \u2013 age, gender presentation \u2013 but this simply flags areas requiring further, System 2-driven investigation. For example, noticing someone\u2019s attire triggering a fleeting \u2018professional\u2019 categorization isn't relied upon; it cues questions about occupation and values to understand the context. She actively mitigates System 1 biases, particularly confirmation bias, by formulating alternative hypotheses and seeking disconfirming evidence. A tendency towards analytical processing leads her to decompose individuals into constituent parts \u2013 personality traits, cognitive styles, defense mechanisms \u2013 analyzing each element before synthesizing a holistic picture. This is not a cold or reductionist process; she views it as necessary for accuracy and avoiding superficial impressions. She specifically leverages established psychological frameworks (e.g., Five Factor Model, Attachment Theory) as structured lenses for organization and interpretation. \\n\\nHowever, Vivian recognizies the limits of pure analytical reasoning. She understands that person description is not simply about objective facts but involves subjective understanding. An element of System 1 processing is systematically re-engaged *after* the extensive System 2 analysis. She employs narrative reconstruction \u2013 mentally \u201cliving\u201d the person\u2019s story, imagining their experiences from their perspective \u2013 to check the \u2018fit\u2019 of her analytical conclusions. This isn\u2019t about feeling or empathy clouding judgement, but rather testing coherence. If the analytically derived profile doesn\u2019t resonate with the reconstructed narrative, the process loops back to System 2 for reassessment of data and interpretations. \\n\\nVivian\u2019s reports themselves reflect this dual-process approach. They are detailed, nuanced, and avoid broad generalizations. She qualifies statements with degrees of probability (\u201cappears to demonstrate\u2026\u201d, \u201cconsistent with a tendency towards\u2026\u201d). Both strengths and vulnerabilities are presented with equal emphasis, explicitly outlining the bases for her conclusions (specific behaviors, test scores, interview responses). She intentionally includes \u2018caveats\u2019 acknowledging the inherent limitations of psychological assessment and the possibility of alternative interpretations.
