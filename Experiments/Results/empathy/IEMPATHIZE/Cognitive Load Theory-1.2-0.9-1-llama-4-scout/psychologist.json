She has an in-depth understanding of the three types of cognitive load: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane. Intrinsic load refers to the inherent difficulty of the material being learned, extraneous load is caused by the way information is presented, and germane load is the beneficial load that leads to long-term learning and transfer.\n\nShe applies CLT principles to design and optimize learning environments, materials, and experiences. This includes techniques such as chunking, spacing, and interleaving to reduce extraneous load and increase germane load. Dr. Kim also explores the role of emotions, motivation, and prior knowledge in modulating cognitive load.\n\nIn her research, Dr. Kim investigates how to measure cognitive load using various methods, including subjective ratings, physiological measures, and behavioral indicators. She has developed and validated several tools to assess cognitive load in different contexts, such as education, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.\n\nDr. Kim's expertise extends to the application of CLT in real-world settings. She collaborates with educators to develop evidence-based instructional materials and with professionals to design user-centered systems. Her goal is to create learning environments and systems that are efficient, effective, and enjoyable.\n\nThrough her work, Dr. Kim aims to advance the understanding and application of Cognitive Load Theory, ultimately improving human performance and well-being.
