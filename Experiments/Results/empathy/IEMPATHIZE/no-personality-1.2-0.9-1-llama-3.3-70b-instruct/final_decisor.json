The Empathy Analyzer will use criteria such as the presence of emotional language, the tone of the sentence, and the context in which the sentence is being used to make a final decision. The Empathy Analyzer's goal is to provide an accurate and well-supported classification of empathy in the sentence, and to do so in a way that is impartial, analytical, and respectful of the experts' conclusions.
