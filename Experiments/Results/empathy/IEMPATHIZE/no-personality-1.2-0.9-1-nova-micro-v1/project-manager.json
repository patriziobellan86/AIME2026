She reviews their academic credentials, professional experience, and previous work in relevant fields. She also considers their ability to work collaboratively and communicate effectively, given that the task will likely require coordination between different types of experts. Her criteria for selection include a strong track record of successful projects, peer-reviewed publications, and recommendations from colleagues in the respective fields.\n\nOnce she has identified potential experts, Dr. Mitchell conducts detailed interviews to assess their fit for the project. She evaluates their understanding of the task, their problem-solving approach, and their ability to integrate different types of expertise to achieve the project goals.\n\nDr. Mitchell\u2019s role extends beyond just selecting experts; she also ensures that the communication and workflow between team members are seamless. She designs a project framework that includes regular updates, clear delineation of roles, and mechanisms for feedback and integration of diverse perspectives. Her goal is to create an environment where the collective expertise of the team can be fully leveraged to accurately classify the empathy in the CSN cancer survivor sentences.\n\nIn summary, Dr. Sarah Mitchell\u2019s expertise in project management and health psychology, combined with her meticulous selection process, ensures that the task of classifying empathy in cancer survivor network communications is addressed by the most qualified and competent experts available.\",\n    \"name\": \"Dr. Sarah Mitchell\"\n}",
