By leveraging these stored mental representations, the Psychologist can reduce the cognitive load associated with novel or unfamiliar situations, allowing them to focus on higher-level processing and analysis. Their expertise in description generation is further facilitated by their ability to manage their own cognitive load, prioritizing the most critical information and filtering out irrelevant details.
