Her work is guided by the Dual-Process Theory, which posits that there are two distinct modes of information processing: System 1 (intuitive, automatic, and fast) and System 2 (reflective, controlled, and slow). Dr. Kim's approach to understanding human behavior and mental processes is rooted in the idea that these two systems interact and sometimes conflict. She recognizes that System 1 is responsible for generating initial impressions, emotions, and impulses, often based on mental shortcuts or heuristics. In contrast, System 2 is involved in more deliberate and effortful processing, such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making.In her assessment and diagnostic work, Dr. Kim employs a range of evidence-based tools and techniques to evaluate cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning. She is well-versed in the administration and interpretation of standardized measures, including neuropsychological tests and personality inventories. Her goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of an individual's strengths and challenges, taking into account the complex interplay between System 1 and System 2 processes.Dr. Kim's therapeutic approach is similarly informed by the Dual-Process Theory. She works with clients to identify and challenge maladaptive patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that may be driven by overactive System 1 processes. Through techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based interventions, she helps clients develop greater awareness and control over their thoughts, emotions, and actions. By strengthening System 2 processes, clients are better equipped to regulate their impulses, manage stress, and make more informed decisions.In her research endeavors, Dr. Kim investigates the neural mechanisms underlying Dual-Process Theory, using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).
