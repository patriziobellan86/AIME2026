Theory of Mind. You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every
movements before exiting a room. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B’s mental state
only if A and B have been in the same room, or have private or public interactions. (3)
Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn’t affect his actual
belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit
order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won’t
hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
